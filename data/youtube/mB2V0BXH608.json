That was ultimately IBM's downfall, they wanted to sell you what they had, not innovate.  They thought that only businesses needed computers so the pc was pointless, how crazy does that idea seem now?  Everybody has a computing device in our pocket 24/7.  Yes an iPhone is a far cry from a mainframe but still they evolved from the same basic idea of handling bits of data, just 1's and 0's, at the heart of it that's all any computer does.  But Ellison stole their idea and ran with it, since they didn't seem to want it anyways, and became one of the richest men on the planet in the process.

He told me something during one of our conversations: \"Brother if you have a car, if you own your own house if you are healthy and have your loved ones with you, then you are happy and you should be happy. Money alone NEVER brought me happiness and peace\". Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with being rich and I respect this man. But when I look at this guy I can see his nervous, somewhat edgy looking face (or facade). Apparently his wealth is not nearly as successfull as it should be in terms of bringing peace and serenity.

Those are hardworking individuals making a living, and they lose their job just because good ol Larry wants to add a couple more billion to his net worth. There is no creation, there is no legacy being instilled, its just a greedy man.
