{"text": "Good thought Michael, but I will one-up you, with all due respect of course, and say it is actually more like this: there is a race and everybody in the race knows the gun is supposed to be shot on the \"1\" of the \"3-2-1\", including the guy shooting the starting gun, who also happens to be in the race. We will call this guy who shoots the gun \"Shooter\". On other race days,, the runners, including shooter, may be told the gun will be shot on \"GO\" as in \"3-2-1-GO\". It doesn't matter how many numbers are counted down before the gun goes off, because only the sound of the gun allows the runners to start; the reason they listen to the announcer is it helps the racers get off the line as efficiently as possible, right when the gun is expected to go off.\n\nNow I will remind you, today's starting gun is set to go off on the \"1\" of \"3-2-1\". Here comes our problem: Shooter, is the only one who has to actually shoot the gun and then begin running; he has a lot to think about, and due to his lack of experience, Shooter has been thinking that the gun is supposed to be shot on the \"GO\" of \"3-2-1-GO\", even though all racers, including our friend Shooter were just reminded to start on \"1\" of \"3-2-1\".  Then the announcer starts counting: \"3\"......\"2\"......\"1\" Everybody except our friend Shooter starts running, as they were expecting the starting shot and were told it would go off at this time. BUT, since the runners can't start until the gun goes off, then it isn't Shooter who is penalized but rather the rest of the racers as indicated by the announcement \"false start on everybody except Shooter\", even though Shooter was, logically speaking, the one who screwed up by waiting too long to shoot the starting gun, he himself never actually ran before the starting gun unlike the other racers and thus wasn't penalized.\n\nHope that was worth it!!! alright!\n\n*sits back in computer chair with pride to take in the moment ...then starts thinking \"wait what the fuck? Was this actually the highlight of my day??? Am I truly proud of the 2.5 hours spent churning out some barely mediocre attempt to explain the nuances of NFL rules via track & field metaphors with characters who seemed to have been created in the same vane as a divorced dad who has convinced himself that 45 years old and lonely is the peak time for creativity and who I act like \"we all know\" because \"he's just good ole' Shooter\" as if the audience (an audience who btw did not really intend to even be a part of this: they didn't pay for it, they didn't come for this, they just kind of stumbled into it, held captive by my semi-intriguing but overly-lofty, complicated-but-not-complex perpetual-run-on-sentence-esque writing. Like an artifact intended to be an object of beauty by its beholders, hypothetically discovered thousands of years on by our \"future ancestors\" until some guy named Thaddeus stumbles upon it while on a jog in goddamn Winnetka, Illinois 997 years short of the intended 1,000 years until discovered gap. Oh, but please call him \"Thad\" and also while you're at it, just grab everybody's smart phone and check their last Google search which should go something like this : is the 'H' in \"Thad\" silent, do I say it like Thad-Pole, do Thad's like the same stuff, the stuff that us normal named and/or not-normal-named-but-actually have a cool name or logically use another onea of the 3 names we were given to go by instead of taking the least fun, least unique name and shortening it so it could only be described as those adjectives above + douchey, that we like, or is this guy just a military vet trained by a mix of Maj. Doosh, Cpl. Punishment, Pvt. Donkeyshowstarringyourmom, and also the mom that breastfeeds her kids until they are 13 years old AKA Thad-Pole's mom?\" After all, this \"artifact\" consisted of only a fidget spinner, an iPhone 6S with 11.0.2 update and a semi-broken-but only-works-if-you-wrap-it around-the-phone phone charger (brought to you by 7-11....\"Come here one day in July for a free watered-down slurpee\") buried by some overly ambitious folks who, for some reason, thought that a time capsule would serve \"future ancestors\" in realizing who \"they\" were, as if our future ancestors would even give a fuck, I mean come on...they have future shit to do, of which may include checking out this YouTube comment section only to realize that it has some sort of magically casual, friendly-but-also-a-major-dickhead-online but definitely overly friendly in person kind of people that are here to say \"TLDR\" and \"[Insert Dank Meme]\" to comments like mine...from fuckbois to trolls, to those old enough to understand what sarcasm is and at that age they are the best and most experienced employers of sarcasm! They use it  properly but think being facetious is equivalent to being on the receiving end of a Cleveland steamer once again dominating the sarcasm stuff, and definitely not too nervous to ask.
