Guys who show no aptitude for math, or programming, come back club meeting after club meeting while girls who show real promise back out because they that their not smart enough. Showing women that they have no reason to fear programming is super important. \n\nP.S.

{"text": "So, just in the past 2 weeks, I've written and thrown out about a dozen parsers for a half dozen completely different syntaxes from scratch in C and over the course of the last 4 years have come up with tons of highly experimental ideas for everything from memory management and concurrent data-oriented design to an exceptionless error-handling model enforced by the type system; from a hypothetical implementation of serializable statically-compiled runtime code-generation with static dispatch via type-injection to using version control deltas to identify side-effects of subroutines and using them to dynamically generate instruction tiles for the backend of a compiler. Last week, I invented a new extremely memory efficient representation for unicode strings that's O(log N) indexable.\n\nWhen I post notes about my work on programming forums; it's completely ignored and I get bitched at for flooding chat boxes. Meanwhile, here's this Harvard student that creates the most useless Python library ever and she gets heralded as the next Alan Turing by MIT Tech Review because she's a woman who can program. I do all of this on my free time. Never been to school for it because I can't afford it.

{"text": "women and men generally do have different interest yes but there's still a sizable amount of girls who like to play videogames. roughly 50% or more gamers are girls, yet females represent hardly a fraction possibly less than 1% in the game development field. and i do believe a large part of that has to do with old myths and stereotypes that one would need to be a rocket scientist in order to code. Just how technology made it more easy to illustrate drawings digitally, getting into game development and programming today is much more feasible. the only thing holding most women back is them feeling like they are incapable of it. So aside from men and women having different interests i do believe there's a large amount of girls who like technology whereas before diamonds may be a girls best friend but now days they like phones.\n\nanyway, it kinda remind me of how in japan the manga industry was heavily dominated by men and comics design for boys. Then eventually a All Female doujin group called Clamp formed to combat the male dominated industry, and now they're quite renown and today there's a slew of genres and subgenres that are geared primarily for girls from shojo, moe and probably more than half the new shows airing now are cutesy and girly whereas in the 80s and 90s, it was typically Sci Fi and Action based.\n\nI would like to believe that all people are individualists who can think for themselves but the reality is most people are followers, conformists, lemmings, who need some guidance. You're saying things that sound good, but it has no basis in reality. Yes people shouldnt be mindless hivemind followers but they are. Some people just need some confidence and i do think that if more women get involved and it gets exposure then it'll help inspire those who were unsure of themselves and think Well if they can make it then maybe i can do too. Because programming is still viewed primarily as a Guy thing. Same with gaming how it used to be viewed mostly for kids  but once lanes open and broaden up, we'll see those old myths being dispelled. \n\nhate to say it but ego is prevalent in a lot of these programming circles. everybody acts so smug, snobby, and looking down on others or they feel like they dont need anyone's advice, suggestion or help because they dont want to appear inept or whatever. tell your homegirls to stop being self absorbed and egocentric and allow others to be inspired by seeing a successful female programmer.\ufeff", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "Pon Pon", "cid": "Ugi_Vq9LTwiIY3gCoAEC.8Rpi7RcVj2p8TFBy03r28n"},

{"text": "\"the only thing holding most women back is them feeling like they are incapable of it\" -- Do not place YOUR insecurities on an entire demographic of people, e.g., women. Just because YOU may feel insecure and incapable due to being a conformist, does not mean all women are. You do not speak for all women, so do not pretend to. You realize your entire argument is based on the assumption that all women are the same, and need to be reassured by others to exhibit their potential?  \n\nYes, there are many women who prefer soldering over snap chat. There are many girls who prefer programming than fashion. There are many girls who do many different things. I have not once objected to this, so please stop formulating your arguments against such things. I am saying GENRALLY women do NOT prefer those things, so that's why you see an inequality.\n\nYour examples, such as the Japanese manga industry(Bear with me, I know little about it) don't prove anything. Just because you show a once male dominated industry has been called into competition by females proves nothing about what we are currently discussing. In this case you are talking about, what I assume to be, animation, drawing, and writing, which GENRALLY women are very good at all 3... so in this instance there is no much surprise to its occurrence, nor relevant to us discussing the tech industry.\n\n\"I would like to believe that all people are individualists who can think for themselves but the reality is most people are followers, conformists, lemmings, who need some guidance\" -- Geez. Be careful, you may choke on all the condescension dripping from your mouth. I agree, some people are followers. The thing about followers is, though they follow other peoples decisions, they CHOOSE who they follow and why. Followers deem what leaders conform most to their own desires, and choose to follow them. There is nothing wrong with this. What IS wrong, is people like YOU who have the audacity to try and tell those followers who to follow (funny enough that it always seems to be people like you want them to follow YOUR desires). Just because you are a follower, does not mean you are stupid and cannot think for yourself. It simply means you function through different motives than others.\n\nI'd also like to take the time to point out you literally just compared ALL women to followers by using that example, and on the contrary, despite your accusation you placed on me, it appears you are the one who needs to lay off the ego and selfishness.\n\n\"ego is prevalent in a lot of these programming circles. everybody acts so smug, snobby, and looking down on others or they feel like they dont need anyone's advice, suggestion or help \" -- Oh you certainly are correct. I witness this all the time. There is also another kind prevalent among programming circles. The type who think everyone else needs THEIR advice, help, and suggestions. I wonder which category you lay in.....\n\nI will tell my \"home girls\" (I usually use the word \"friend\", but whatever) nothing. Unlike you, I don't feel the need to tell others what to do, how to think, or what to be. The only thing I do want from people, is to live and let live. I'm sure in your head you see yourself as some female inspiring spirit fighter, shouting for the world to \"let my people go\". In reality your just satisfying your ego(Something you have obsessively mentioned quite often now) by thinking other people should want to be just like you... because after all, you are such a strong independent women, unlike those pesky annoying followers who don't seem to understand what they want.

{"text": "Well you know how females are overrepresented in biolody, psychology, social sciences and so one while men are overrepresented in technical fields like engineering, physics, mathematics, computer science and so on. The current idea many people have is that this is socially constructed and women are being pushed into medicine and so on while men go into technological fields and we want to remove the boundaries so that every women who has an interest in a technological field feels free to study that. You might say that women can do that now which is true but also far from reality because it ignores how many parents are stuck in the past of gender roles therefore push their ideas onto their children (which will always happen) and then might lead their kids to believe that women cannot go into technological fields (same for men in the other direction). So if there is someone who is a female and happens to be skilled and intelligent enough to become a professor in computer science it can be a boost to young girls who are interested in programming while being pushed in another direction by their parents. Believe me, not everyone is as progressive as you.\n\nI've also heard that there is a biological reason why women tend to be more interested in social sciences then men and men being more interested in technological sciences, I think they used Norway as an example of being the most emancipated  in terms of gender but actually having the biggest gender differences in said jobs. \nThe fun part is that it doesn't even matter if it's true or not, what matters is that people have to feel free to choose their career according to their interests and skills. Keep in mind that even if women on average have a higher interest in for example social science it doesn't mean that every women has a higher interest in social sciences but if you check the numbers of women who have a higher interest in social sciences is higher than the number of men that do and I think this is a misunderstanding that causes a lot of trouble at the moment.\n\nWhy do we focus on women?

It pretty much just looks like Python, because the syntax is the same. It is the semantics that have changed.\n\nAs for why Python was chosen, it's probably because that's the language the DSL's creator knows best: MIT loves Python.\n\nThe other reason is that Python is one of the only languages where you could really do this. The other big languages where it would be possible (and where this sort of thing would be traditionally implemented) are Common Lisp and the Schemes (which would be a kickass name for a rock band).\n\nIn fact, 10-15 years ago, I bet this would have been implemented in Scheme, seeing as it came out of academia. Both Common Lisp and most Schemes have facilities that make this sort of thing far easier to implement, and it would probably have been much cleaner as well: Python AST manipulation sucks. However, 6.001 is no more, and so Python it is. :-(\ufeff", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Thoth Of The XVth", "cid": "UggHVAwaBGHP9HgCoAEC.8PyMJTDt9QC8WO5_rxOLB8"},
{"text": "Josh Barrett hmm. Thanks for the explanation and link.\nTo me it seems like it's going to be really slow. I was thinking that it could have been implemented in Haskell in a few lines (a wrapper type that can have functors applied but that hides its wrapee and only allows extraction when a specific key is passed in, then functions can be type checked to not be able to unwrap the value but can still perform the allowed operations on it). Then you avoid all those interpretation issues and get static type checking. Also I'd expect someone to call _dict_ on everything and probably find a way to extract values anyway.\nStill, kinda cool.\ufeff", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Joshua Pratt", "cid": "UggHVAwaBGHP9HgCoAEC.8PyMJTDt9QC8WO8By5v60D"},
{"text": "Joshua Pratt You actually wouldn't be able to do it in Haskell. Not properly. Reason being, you can't enforce the boundaries you make. Assuming I understand Jeeves' semantics (I think I do, but I may be wrong), your view of the object is restricted, and that restriction is enforced at runtime. If you call __dict__, you should only see the bits of the object you can access, and even if you can see more, your access attempt should be terminated. It's chroot(2) for objects, but actually secure (probably: see the disclaimer about my understanding of the semantics).\n\nYou can't force that kind of verification using pure Haskell. Somebody could always bypass your verfication function and access the data directly. Yeah, they're not supposed to, but if someone can, than someone will. You need to bake it into the language itself: you add a call to the function (decorator, whatever), and accesses get verified at compile/runtime. In order to do this, you need to run code at compile time to rewrite the function and add those checks, or otherwise do the verification. So Haskell can't do it.\n\n...But Template Haskell probably can. As can (I think) Forth, and the Lisps (as I mentioned), because Lisp programmers do this sort of thing for fun.\ufeff", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Thoth Of The XVth", "cid": "UggHVAwaBGHP9HgCoAEC.8PyMJTDt9QC8WOBhdfqP1i"},

That's no ordinary decorator: it's re-writing the AST of your function to use Jeeves primitives (if, function calls, and so on): The result is a language with the same syntax as Python, but different primitives, and therefore different *semantics*: Hence, it's a new language. A DSL, technically, but they likely simplified the title of the video for the unwashed masses.\n\nAnd if you'd ever used Common Lisp in your damned life (or were otherwise aware of some variant of Lisp or Scheme-style macros), and done about 5 minutes of careful research, then I could have wasted less of my time explaining all this to you.\ufeff", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Thoth Of The XVth", "cid": "UgjO3WzjroRFPngCoAEC.8JAmIDCsjYG8WKCxlJumb_"},
