To kill muslim in the name of allah? But I guess you dont really care huh?

Do all white people collectively march against violence when a white guy shoots up a school? NO. Because it's pointless, a sick guy with a bomb is going to blow himself up regardless of any 'peace rally'. Even so, there have been countless Muslim peace marches, most recently in Barcelona, London and Cologne. Still, these terrorists have been condemned by all the highest and respected sheikhs, Muftis and Imams. There have been very generous donations by many Muslims after terror attacks, take Al Waleeds 10 million donation to NY city after 9/11 for example, or the countless anti-terror fundraisers they have. You only don't see this because you're ignorant and choose to ignore it, you'd rather see shitty propaganda from facebook and youtube comment sections..\nA peace treaty in Syria? High and mighty that you talk about peace in Syria even though its non-muslims countries that are funding that war and pouring in billions to keep it going. \nSending trillions to Africa? Don't make me laugh, even if that were true, it would still be nothing compared to what has been taken from them. Under colonialism we drew there borders and completely stripped the vast majority of Africa of its resources. Now today, those borders still hold and are causing absolute mayhem, and you have filthy rich companies knowingly exploiting the situation and creating slave like conditions for these people in many communities.\nThere is a fundamental difference between killing in the name of god and being a mental patient? Can't you be both? Mentally ill people are very susceptible to being indoctrinated into these radical sects. ISIS THRIVES on those people. Almost every person who commits these 'acts of terror in the name of Islam' are some sort of whackjob who just converted a few days back on the internet, or someone who has been depressed half there life.

For one precious moment the arrows hang in the air, then plummet to the ground, killing and wounding orcs all along the front lines.\n\nstep\n\nSound has returned to the world and the shield wall picks up pace as the song draws to a close. Arrows rain down upon the orcs, a glittering hailstorm.\n\nstep\n\nThe white rider raises his arm and the orcs are blinded by a sudden flash of light. The last volley has been spent, the shield wall charges towards the orcs at maximum speed. \n\nThere is a loud crash of splintering wood as the two sides come together. Like shafts are shattered, shields are splintered. Men die, orcs die, but the men are inside the reach of the pikes, stabbing, hacking, cutting the orcs to pieces.\n\nThe orcs break.

{"text": "The Uruk-Hai are superb heavy infantry. Big, mean, and resilient. That scene in Two Towers where they've been on the run from Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, they move at a full sprint in heavy iron plate all day for several days straight and show they have inhuman endurance and stamina. Not to mention they reacted with admirable military precision to the appearance of Gandalf and the Rohirrim, realigning their flank and forming pike lines without hesitation. If only they had held out in the face of the blinding sun (a dubious prospect, but one that has been addressed more than enough already), that heroic charge would have been broken like a driftwood raft on rocks. And even blind, if they simply held the pikes before them and shut their eyes, the overlapping layers would still have caught the horses. I kind of want to see a movie where the bad guys win because they have the strength and resources to do so. The closest thing to that would be the Hoth scene from Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, but then its no fun if the good guys don't overcome impossible odds.\ufeff", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "GasMaskTrenchCoat", "cid": "UggtdGCtYv6paXgCoAEC"},

The orcs are also goddamn retarded for such a trained fighting force. They do absolutely nothing with their pikes.
