{"text": "Beware of satanic hollywood brainwashing promotion of a deceiving charlatan. Why did this liar never expose the formula for the apparent curvature of the earth? Why did he never say that the curve should be 66feet over ten miles? Why did he never give us the formula for how the surface of water apparently curves around vast expanses of land we call oceans? I'll tell you why. Because there is NO curve on earth. He deflected that little formality by going straight to fantasy gravity. The suez canal is 100 miles with no locks. You can see Corsica from 137 miles away. It should be more than a mile over the curve! Antarctica is 30degrees colder than the arctic and does not get 24hour sunlight. Earth is flat as Almighty God made it as it says in Genesis in the KJV bible. This liar knew it and deceived the world. He didn't do it alone. He did it with the backing of satanic Hollywood and the rothschilds / aka red nation establishment\u00a0who work out of the satanic\u00a0 sovereign state city of London. Just one example of how these evil sort work is the battle of waterloo. They spread the rumour that Britain\u00a0lost the war so they could buy the cheap shares and then make a killing when the truth came out! Nice people those that hold the world banks.
