Lying is the way Trump has operated his whole life, and he got beat at his own game by Wolff.  This does not mean that by extension, Wolff's book is a lie. Many people are thankful Wolff has written the book. \n\nTrump's own game with world leaders is to dump a string of shallow flattery on them, about how great their country is, and beautiful the people are. This is considered to be Trump's talent. It worked for the campaign, with his gullible base. Now that Trump is president, it would be better if he could read something, or had a grasp of issues, law and history, or at least could listen to those who do.\n\nAs a few others have pointed out, this is a potentially catastrophic weakness of Trump's. Whether is is Putin or another foreign leader, Trump can be easily fooled merely by stroking his ego, or when he thinks he has something at stake having to do with his image, or especially his personal financial well-being.  And those around Trump are too fearful of his unstable, egotistical, vengeful and unpredictable behavior to do anything about it, even if they suspected Wolff's book on Trump and associates could include critical things, just like his book on Murdoch.   \n\nWolff gaining the amount of access he did is a testament to the truth in his book, as observed by others. Wolff suggested that Trump probably didn't even read the earlier article on him, but found the picture with sunglasses flattering. Trump didn't read Wolff's book on Murdoch either, which was another reason Trump allowed Wolff access, as requested by Bannon.  \n\nSo, Trump doesn't read, or really listen to the advice of others, but instead depends on their LOYALTY, and in this case it was depending on the loyalty of Bannon. This is dangerous! And this is why Trump depends so much on his daughter and Kushner, even if they are both inexperienced, and incompetent, considering the important role they play and the influence they have. Trump trusts them because they are loyal.\ufeff", "time": "9 \u6642\u9593\u524d\uff08\u7de8\u96c6\u6e08\u307f\uff09", "author": "Timzart7", "cid": "UgyS6CcxE-A5ecHKxqV4AaABAg"},

I think Wolff picked up on that rather quickly but unfortunately he isnt very articulate in person. His point was \"Yes, I initially set out with the goal to write a book looking to humanize the president and offer the president an avenue to defend himself to the public. But as time went on and I've spoken to many staffers, the dialogue quickly devolved into one that is heated, untrusted, and vile.

The real nightmare for China is someone in US wakes up and focus on ECONOMY, TRADE, and MANUFACTURE again before China overtakes US and makes US a second class country. But do liberals care about these, NO. They want everyone to smoke pot, they want US to not to produce anything anymore, they want to take in more worthless immigrants.

This is much different than the left wing politics of western culture known as Liberalism, which is defined by wanting more government intervention, high taxes, more regulations, less free market capitalism and more central planning, and the whole social justice warrior movement. Conflating the two and saying \"right wingers hate freedom\" is a strawman argument of the highest order. No right winger is going around saying they want to use the power of the government to prevent people who disagree with them from expressing themselves. In fact, it is left wingers fighting for more censorship of what they deem \"hate speech\" and they keep moving the goal post so that \"hate speech\" is anything they disagree with.

{"text": "\"I could just as easily decide to define \"Conservatism\" as seeking make a virtue of being a selfish, ignorant, racist, xenophobic, obnoxious and rude asshole!\"\n\nNo, you couldn't. Nothing about the policies that define conservatism, IE small government and low taxes, have anything to do with anything you just said. Are you offended by my definition of liberal? Those are generally the types of policies they favor, large government.\nLeft wing = more government with the far extreme being communism, \nRight wing = less government with the extreme being anarchism. \nPretty simple really. Conservatives run on platforms of less government, low taxes for everyone, etc.\nLiberals run on raising the taxes of rich people so that the government can be expanded to more and more fragments of everyday life. \n\n\"access to education, healthcare, etc.\"\n\nAnd the best way to make those things affordable? Keep government 100% out of them. Did you know that both industries were far more affordable only a few generations ago, then the government started telling poor people it would subsidize whatever they couldn't afford, so the colleges and hospitals realized that no matter how high they set their prices, people would continue seeking their services at the same rate because the government would pay for it. That's why there is so much inflation in those particular industries, and there would only be more if we funded them both with a single payer system. This has nothing to do with what we were discussing, just a little economics lesson for you. Single payer would bankrupt our government, cause hyperinflation, and once free market principles were removed from the industries, they would function far less efficiently. This is why we call liberals stupid, because they hear morons like Bernie make these promises, and without even considering potential negative consequences to society they jump on the bandwagon because they think about the short term decrease in expenses they could potentially see as a result.\n\n\"but they ARE spending their days here attacking anybody they think might have a different opinion.\"\n\nYeah, it's called political discourse. I'm currently in college and spend a lot of time on the internet, a lot of which I spend debating people because for some reason I enjoy it. Personal attacks over politics are stupid, but to take away from the attacks that the person making them must be against that person's freedom to think that way is retarded. And the attacks made by left wingers against right wingers are a million times more immature and idiotic than vice versa, at least since Trump's victory. I'll say that during the Obama years it was the other way around, but the way lefties attack Trump supporters with no facts, strictly ad hominem juvenile insults, is unparalleled in the history of political discourse. Nevertheless, I would not accuse them of hating freedom because they disagree with me (when I said you love Nazis I was sarcastically making fun of YOUR retarded claims that right wingers are Nazis, which your only evidence for is that they attack people who disagree with them. The whole rationale was fucking stupid). So why is it ok for left wingers to make personal attacks on Trump supporters, but if right wingers attack Bernie supporters you consider it a fascist strategy of suppressing ones ability to disagree? Might it just be a matter of you agreeing more with one side than the other perhaps?\n\n\"there is no virtue in calling somebody a \"Libtard\" or a commie because have an opinion that you don't like.\"\n\nBut you literally just called right wingers \"Nazis or fascists or something\". Everything else you said in that paragraph (\"there is no virtue in being racist, hating gay people, blah blah blah\") I agree with. None of those things are right wing beliefs, contrary to the interpretation that the media feeds you. We just don't want the government setting regulations and raising taxes that force us to do shit we don't want to pay for. Nobody is abusing gays, nobody hates people from other countries, we just don't want our tax money to subsidize them. Learn the difference, and maybe you will be able to have a political discussion without making a bunch of logical fallacies that don't even make sense.\n\n\"there is no virtue in me saying that, but if you want to make a direct and idiotic attack like that then you deserve it.\"\n\nLike I said, I was being sarcastic, but you LITERALLY said three comments ago that being anti-liberal makes somebody a Nazi and/or fascist. So why is it ok for you to make such egregious generalizations but not me? How much of a hypocrite are you? Or are you just not smart enough to pick up on your own inconsistent ideals about \"virtue\"?\ufeff", "time": "46 \u5206\u524d", "author": "Erocktyle", "cid": "UgzprWJ76VBIe5iurFZ4AaABAg.8bMoP-4THyS8bO60fpSLiF"},

The liberal mainstream media has an agenda and have been forcing it down your throats for some time now. You people are just to mindless too see it. I\u2019m not joking or trying to piss you off, I truly am incredibly sad for anyone who is liberal or a democrat. Here is a paper by Saul Alinsky:\n\nRecall that Hillary did her college thesis on his writings and Obama writes about him in his books. Saul Alinsky died about 43 years ago, but his writings influenced those in political control of our nation, Anyone out there think that this stuff isn't happening today in the U.S.? All eight rules are currently in play. How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky: There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state. The first is the most  = \nimportant. 1) Healthcare!! Control healthcare and you control the people. 2) Poverty!! Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live. 3) Debt!! Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty 4) Gun Control!! Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police State. 5) Welfare!! Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income) 6) Education!! Take control of what people read and listen to take control of what children learn in school  7) Religion!! Remove the belief in the God from the government and he schools. 8)  Warfare!! Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor.This will cause more discontent, and it will be easier to (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor. Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States? Alinsky merely simplified Vladimir Lenin's original scheme for world conquest by communism, under Russian rule. Stalin described his converts as \"Useful Idiots.\" The Useful Idiots have destroyed every nation in of which they have seized power and control.

{"text": "The House of Savoy are a top royal bloodline and the owners of the Genovese crime family which are extorting Wall Street for the House of Savoy. The Savoy family governed Geneva for a period of time in service to the Vatican and were Dukes of Genova, Italy. Vittorio Emanuele IV holds the title of Prince of Naples and has a residence in Geneva Switzerland. The House of Savoy ruled the Dukedom of Savoy located in the Swiss-French-Italian region. The Genovese crime family take their name from Vito Genovese who was born in a Naples commune just as Vittorio is the Prince of Naples. The Gigante family that also ran the Genovese crime family were also from Naples. Genovese is a surname for someone from Genoa Italy or from Geneva Switzerland. Genoa or Genova in Italian is the same word as Geneva is Swiss. Prince Vittorio is married to the wicked Princess Marina Doria who was born in Switzerland. The Doria family were one of the wealthiest banking families in Genoa for centuries. The Savoy family also had a Savoy-Genovese family branch which recently married in with the Roman House of Massimo. Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV has numerous criminal charges and investigations against him including murder, association with organized crime, corruption, and exploitation of prostitution. He tends to get off on all his charges though. Prince Vittorio was also a member of the P2 Masonic Lodge which was involved with the Vatican, Italian government, Italian media, and organized crime like the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari fascist paramilitary group and Banda della Magliana or Magliana Mafia. The Savoy family put the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in power who established the Vatican as a sovereign nation through the Lateran Treaty of 1929. The House of Savoy and Black Nobility used Mussolini to establish the Vatican as a nation and to weaken and persecute their opposition in Italy. Members of the House of Savoy include Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV of Savoy the Prince of Naples, Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy the Prince of Venice, Princess Maria Isabella of Savoy-Genoa, Prince Amedeo of Savoy-Aosta, and Prince Aimone of Savoy-Aosta.\n\nThe Savoy family has ruled in Italy, Switzerland, France, Cyprus, Albania, and regions of North Africa as dukes, monarchs, and emperors. They have intermarried with various royal and noble families including the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Glucksburg, Hesse, Bourbon, Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Medici, and Orleans families. They share a similar ancestry with the House of Hanover. The Savoy family established the Liberty of the Savoy in London in 1246. There is a Savoy Hotel in London named in honor of the House of Savoy.  Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV is a top hidden owner of the Genovese crime family which has infiltrated Wall Street and extorts businessmen in the United States. The Genovese crime family is much larger than what is reported and have a black hand mafia and white collar division with many British and German business associates involved in Wall Street. The Savoy family use the mafia to influence the trading on the stock market for their interests formerly through SIX Swiss Exchange and now through Deutsche Borse.  In the 90's White Rock Partners and State Street Capital Markets were involved in some mafia tied stock fraud. What the Genovese crime family do is threaten and extort stock brokers for inside information and deals used in international trading. The Genovese's Greenwich Village mafia faction run Manhattan along with Lucchese made men with Andrew Gigante as a covert boss. Liborio Bellomo runs the Genovese's Bronx faction. Prince Vittorio has also worked as a Swiss broker, arms dealer, and military grade helicopter salesman for Agusta and was investigated for selling military weapons and aircraft to Arab nations under weapons sanctions. The Agusta family are a Sicilian nobility and owned Agusta Helicopters now part of Leonardo-Finmeccanica headed up by Giovanni De Gennaro. Agusta has been in contract with the United States military and Leonardo-Finmeccanica is one of the largest defense contractors in the world. Count Rocky Agusta is the head of the Sicilian House of Agusta. Prince Vittorio's son Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy and the Prince of Venice also has a high authority over his father's criminal empire. The House of Savoy have a great deal of hidden wealth in private Swiss banks and use this for funding fascism, persecution, secret societies, and political corruption.\ufeff", "time": "11 \u6642\u9593\u524d", "author": "Izreal Zeus", "cid": "Ugy6se22xxPBHVv6AU54AaABAg.8bMlJUHvJzx8bMudYz0wYY"},

Fiction, on the other hand, is by far the most successful book genre, and make no mistake, this book is pure fiction, even CNN took the author to task on the ridiculous amount of factual errors.

Be honest with yourself liberals, if Ed Klein (a guy who has written tabloid fiction books like this, but about Democrats) said something like that, you would laugh in his face and use the quote as justification to generalize all conservatives as alternative fact spewing liars.

Trump, however, is universally regarded by friend and foe alike as an utter moron, who\u2019s very clearly a genuinely bad person - clearly a racist and bigot, who\u2019s appealed to the worst levels of America to stoke fears and division, as well as alienating America from her oldest allies. (Which is why he\u2019s terrified to go to Britain, as he knows damn well that enormous protests and hostility are waiting for him even from America\u2019s oldest ally.) There\u2019s plenty of skepticism about the contents of this salacious book - but there\u2019s also plenty of belief that much of it is true. Not all, but much of it - and for even a little bit of it to be true is an alarming prospect.

{"text": "The House of Torlonia are the top bankers on the planet and the Vatican's treasurers. The Torlonia family are overseeing the United States Treasury and private Swiss bank accounts of the Italian Nobility. The French word \"Tor\" means tower and the Torlonia family have French ancestry. Lonia is like loan. Torlonia means loan tower. The family is overseeing the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland which is designed as a tower and is stealing wealth from the central banks around the world through fraudulent tax contracts. The Vatican and Swiss Cantons have been in contract for centuries and that is why the Swiss Guard protects the Vatican City State today. The Geneva flag uses a papal key on it. The UBS Bank partly created by the Warburg family also uses papal keys for its logo. Switzerland and the Vatican City State are the only two nations on the planet that use the square shaped flag. Switzerland is basically a Papal State. The Torlonia family are closely connected with the House of Savoy who have ruled over regions of Switzerland. Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV of Savoy has a residence in Geneva today. The Torlonia family are covert owners of the Civella crime family of Kansas City and LaRocca crime family of Pittsburg which are allied with the Savoy owned Genovese crime family. The Torlonia family are the Princes of Civitella-Cesi similar to the name of the Civella crime family. The House of Torlonia are married with the Spanish Bourbon royal family and have part ownership of the Juarez Cartel.\n\nThe Torlonia family intermarried with the Borghese banking family of Rome. Pope Paul V or Camillo Borghese founded the Bank of the Holy Spirit in 1605 and it more recently merged with Banca di Roma which merged with Capitalia and then merged with Unicredit and went into contract with Santander, Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic. These contracts ended in July 2016 right after it was exposed. Unicredit is a popular bank in Europe and its headquarters is in Rome. The House of Torlonia is also intermarried with the Javal banking family of France and the royal family of Luxembourg. The Torlonia family were a branch of the Conti di Siegni family of Italy that moved to France and intermarried with French Alsacien bankers before returning to Italy as the House of Torlonia. The Conti family had a family branch in Venice where the Warburg or Del Banco family originated just as their Unicredit proxy was in contract with Warburg Pincus. They have deep connections with French bankers and recently married into the royal family of Luxembourg. Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg's wife is Princess Sibilla Torlonia and he worked for the International Monetary Fund. Luxembourg's former Minister of Finance Luc Frieden was Chairman for the Board of Governors of the IMF and World Bank Group. Banking in Luxembourg is private just like in Switzerland.\n\nThe Borghese family have a dragon on their coat of arms and they live in Rome. Drago similar to Draghi is the Italian word for dragon. Mario Draghi was born in Rome, was Jesuit educated from the Massimiliano Massimo Institute, and he is one of the most powerful bankers in society as President of the European Central Bank. Mario Draghi is also on the board of directors for the Bank for International Settlements and a member of the Group of Thirty. Mario Draghi, Fabio Panetta, and Ignazio Visco are all from Italy and all directly tied to Rome and board directors for the Bank for International Settlements. The Torlonia and Borghese families have a great deal of concealed wealth and own various palaces through out Italy. Benito Mussolini rented the Torlonia Villa in Rome from the Torlonia family. Prince Junio Valerio Borghese was a naval commander under Mussolini. These banking families are funding and managing fascist secret societies in the United States who serve Rome. The Torlonia family also hold the continual position of Prince Assistant to the Papal Throne at the Vatican City State. The Borghese family have part ownership of the Philly Mob and share ownership of the Pittsburg crime family with the House of Torlonia. Members of the Torlonia crime family include Prince Giovanni Torlonia, Prince Marino Torlonia, Duke Leopoldo Torlonia, Don Guido Torlonia, Count Alessandro Lequio-Torlonia, and of the Borghese crime family is Princess Alessandra Borghese, Prince Lorenzo Borghese and Don Scipione Borghese.\n\nhttp://it.fashionnetwork.com/news/Il-principe-Torlonia-lancia-i-suoi-profumi,899798.html#.WlHDnXtFy1s\n\nPrince Giovanni Torlonia \n\nhttp://www.elmundo.es/loc/2014/12/10/54872760268e3e8b278b456f.html\n\nAlessandro Lecquio-Torlonia with the deceased Marco Torlonia\n\nhttp://www.dagospia.com/mediagallery/dago_gallery-14034/260585.htm\n\nGiudo Torlonia\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Prince_of_sulmona_scipione_borghese.PNG\n\nScipione Borghese\ufeff", "time": "11 \u6642\u9593\u524d", "author": "Izreal Zeus", "cid": "UgwLb0993aQsqqvNGJ94AaABAg.8bMk3Phpaca8bMuazpt581"},
