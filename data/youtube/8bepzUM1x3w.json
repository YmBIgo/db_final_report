Jobs and his Computers were the laughing stock of the 80s. Nobody used them because they were Way To expensive, Lack of Software library and compatible hardware (that was affordable), No industrial Application, and most importantly, no freedom of writing and marketing your own software compatible with them. It was basically an Fuck you to Computing standards that most people refused to jump on the Bandwagon for. For example, you couldnt use the Hayes Smartmodem at all with the Apple, which wouldnt allow you to connect with BBSes. You had to use the piece of Shit AppleTalk that could only connect to their own network.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe real computers that defined the 80s were the IBM PC, Commodore 64 and Amiga, DEC VAX and the Z80 computers.

My friends 2000+ dollar Mac desktop sucks compared to my 1000+ dollar HP. And my 600 dollar HP laptop is a hell of a lot better (in my opinion) than my sisters 1000+ dollar macbook pro. And I'll guarantee both of my HP's will last longer. And work better for longer.\n\nBut you do have to admit, he did change cell phones forever with the iPhone. It takes HTC, Samsung, and Windows just to compete with the iPhone line.

{"text": "I think his Contributions to smartphone is what saved his legacy more than anything. He isnt an engineer, so I as an engineer can't give him the credit of building the damn thing. I give that to the programmers and hardware engineers who have to live up to his standards. But he may have came up with the ideas of improving the blackberry and newton and he came out with the Iphone.\u00a0\n\nTo this day, I cannot think of one person who cared, much less used, the Lisa Computer back in the 80s. The True father of the PC revolution was the IBM PC. Thats why the its called the PC revolution and the computers we have today are built on its Architecture. Here is the thing you have to understand regarding computers in the 80s. Back then, computers had very limited functions and you had to get software to operate them. Software was bought from a store or written by yourself or friends. Apple was against people writing their own software and they had a ridiculous certification program to allow people to program, let alone market software for their computers. And they usually cost much more, in addition to the extreme cost of the Computers themselves. Thats why Apple was such a failure in the 80s. Software was limited and expensive.\u00a0\n\nIn regards to the Lisa, the Lisa was built on the Motorolla 68000 platform and the only thing unique about it was how it wasted its potential. The 68000 used Flat-line memory to operate, meaning that unlike the 8086, there was no paging requirements and it could have run 10 times as fast as the 8086 of the IBM. But because they had a Document Centric OS, they had to constantly save and load the data in the Registers than just running it through making it much slower in the end. Programming the LISA was also a pain in the ass for that reason. Most 80s computer geeks like myself consider the true Revolutionary of the GUI comptuer to be the Commodore Amiga (which was also built on the 68000 but was much more utilizing of its potential).\u00a0\ufeff", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Gholam Ahangari", "cid": "UghNJHzgX8flB3gCoAEC.84c2524Nnma70VD1QEoHH6"},
