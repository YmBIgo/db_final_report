{"text": "+Riley Pennell\u00a0sure might not make sense to you... to you. but to me now pay attention, to me girl means young most likely underage teen even younger maybe, to me my opinion. A female is a very general word and does not highlight age at all. So she mentions in the video if you paid attention to her comments, that people are astonished or amazed by what she does and is capable when it comes to climbing. Maybe because of her age or maybe because of her size, so that is why i mention in my comment that i dont see a girl ( now remember girl to me sounds like a kid ) I see a female kicking ass, which she is a female and she is kicking ass.\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "WatsHyped", "cid": "Ugi-7r-AceRNDngCoAEC.89hZRP6eNeK89k-1ebPntT"},
{"text": "+GiVeMeAbReAkWaKeUp I'm making implications upon your wording not necessarily what you believe as many ideas can be contrived from what you wrote. Doesn't take a genius to think up what I said above, 2 minutes in total to be exact. I also don't see how I'm the invalid in the situation when although your comment was well intended inverted on itself. Female defines woman and girl as one lessening by interpretation the significance of the achievements made by a girl at age 14 and by extension in your mind may mean women as a whole are badass which is true but matches her with talents beyond her years she isn't on par with, however as a strong young woman/girl of 14 years she raises the bar of athletic ability for young women/girls to strive for that will spark a trend of dedication thereafter for other girls her age to try new things such as rock climbing.\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "elysiums abattoir", "cid": "Ugi-7r-AceRNDngCoAEC.89hZRP6eNeK89k-b_Cc_zp"},

Look you just turned a comment I made saying something from my point of view and mine alone on how i dont see her as a girl but rather as a female kicking ass into a debate???? Are you bored??? she is a girl she is a female she is kicking ass! and my comment is not inverted in any way. if that was a boy or male, boy is something you say to a young male or kid. saying FEMALE elevates her above age and yes does put her against other women in accomplishment. \u00a0\u00a0\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "WatsHyped", "cid": "Ugi-7r-AceRNDngCoAEC.89hZRP6eNeK89k1kYbh3x1"},

If you dont get what im saying then you are over generalizing! and you dont even notice it. You just think all people think the same and when i tell you why i said not a girl but a female because her attitude to training and applying herself and a whole fucking smorgasbord of other reasons elevate her to a much more mature level and so she should be spoken of as such! your an idiot and made yourself look over critical of others! yeah now i am going to do what you do and over analyze something that is not there!\u00a0\n\nOh and take away from other young girls boo hoo what the fuck are you on about! im talking about her and only her.\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "WatsHyped", "cid": "Ugi-7r-AceRNDngCoAEC.89hZRP6eNeK89k3vMPYAkk"},
