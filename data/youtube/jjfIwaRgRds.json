{"text": "The public masses are so easily susceptible to idiocy.  Do you honestly think Bill Gates is an altruistic billionaire saint?  He's partnered and funds MONSANTO.  If you have any knowledge of this company, you would think otherwise of \"heroic\" Bill's telos.  Even in this video, it stated Monsanto, has patents owning both the GMO seeds and the pesticides.  That is spiritually profane, morally abhorrent, and ethically deplorable.   Oh and his beautiful wife: Melinda Gates.  What an angel, oh my; do you honestly think she would have married Bill if he was not Bill Gates?  Honestly....get real...get educated.  It is cliche to refer to the masses as sheeple, and I might be one as well, who knows? Considering one cannot necessarily and pragmatically assess their own epistemi.  However, all these recent events: Trump as commander in chief, recession, waste of life skinheads, abhorrent legislation getting passed, is due to your ignorance, indifference, stupidity, the top tier's ability to control you as pawns, (at the drop of a nickel), etc., rests on the shoulders of the most nondedicated/uneducated donuts, our country has ever witnessed (I am talking about the majority of you people).  Get educated, go read some books or a book, disconnect from the corporate-government controlled media, think for yourself, get organized, start movements.  Do fucking something besides sitting lackadaisically on your fat asses watching some rhetorical bullshit.  Stop trusting the government, Congress, representatives: THEY DO NOT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU.  Intuitively, Bill does not possess the qualities as Steve Jobs did.  Bill is a charlatan when it comes to philanthropy, as the majority of philanthropists are.  I am not one to get into conspiracy theories; being pragmatic and realistic, but have any of you donuts, lamenting this secretly malicious population control/depopulation advocate, actually know anything about genetically modified foods?  Do you really think a billionaire and egoist would want to increase the population of an already overpopulated earth?  What is his telos (means to an end for those not versed in basic Greek fundamental philosophy, which I am guessing is most of you.)?  I am not normally this pessimistic and believe it or not, am a progressive-libertarian with humanitarian values.  However, in order for some changes to get implemented in some manner, people who have some sense of education and ethics really need to be truthful on how easily manipulated you people are.  Bill's ideology, I am sure is in correlation with Hobbesian and Malthusian ideology.  Awww, but Bill is so sincere, look at the manner in which he speaks, his body language, and his, \"philanthropic\" efforts, as cyclically promulgated by the MEDIA....Need I say more?  Monsanto + Bill Gates + GMO's + Media = yay happiness, and an egalitarian commune for all to live in prosperity.

Unless they use pesticides, they will lose more than half the crops, but the only pesticides they're allowed to use contain so much copper it makes the ground useless and infirtile after a few growth cycles. Leading to the growth of \"organic\" foods requiring moving the crops to different fields all the time to avoid poisoning the plants, and the groundwater. The amount of aluminium used in modern pesticides for \"non-organic\" foods are in such small amounts that they don't get picked up by the plants to any harmful degree to neither humans, animals, or vegetation, and they don't poison the groundwater, which means the same area can be used again and again.\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Senatsu", "cid": "UghKh2sakFlFEXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7--Fsj8Cogr7moKAq"},

If I wanted to, I can build a desktop and then use Hackintosh to install iOS and the PC I built will be running Apple platform iOS then. You were comparing hardware to software. Get some knowledge before bashing Windows platform.\n\nI built my friend's desktop, which is composed of i7 4th generation, OCZ 64GB DDR3 2000Mhz ram, 200GB SSD, 3TB Western Digital Hard Drive 7200 RPM, XFX Radeon R9 8GB GPU ram with liquid cooling, Asus touchscreen 24 inch monitor, Logitech Performance MX Mouse, Logitech K800 keyboard, Thermaltake liquid cooling case while also having 8 big fans, this beasty machine that I assembled for my friend beats ANY Apple desktops and laptops and its future models ANYDAY. And I know there are gamers out there who can even blow this specs out of the water with better specs. It'll take Apple about 5 years to barely match upto my friend's desktop. And he bought all of this at either half the price or less than the most expensive Apple desktop. My friend installed Windows but he could've used Hackintosh and installed Apple iOS if he wanted to. But of course, he and I both hate Apple iOS platforms.\n\nApple sucks. It's features are limited and it has lot of compatibility issues. It's only for people who don't do much with their computers besides basic activities such as listening to music, surfing the web, checking emails. For someone who are either serious gamers, programmers, video editors, etc, Apple sucks. Apple however due to its limited platform, is simplistic that DJs use it since there's lower chance of crashing than Windows since platform is very limited and simplistic.
