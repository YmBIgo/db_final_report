Sometimes its better to assume for survival purposes that there is a snake in the grass or a tiger behind the bush even when its just the wind, because paranoia makes survival more likely than a completely investigative spirit would.\n\nThe brain gets around this for things that don't have immediately cognitively obvious benefits and rewards by having built-in reward mechanisms via the emotional subsystems and at a lower level a system specifically dedicated to reward/punishment (pain/pleasure and emotion have a lot to do with how memories form and how well they are stored)\ufeff", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Michael Gooch", "cid": "Ugh8bFwy0iA5m3gCoAEC.8VIMi3-oDav8VnzbamWksU"},

{"text": "Hello, I was wondering if someone could help me. I have a specific situation to which I would like to apply a machine learning algorithm, but I'm not sure  which one to use.\n\nLet's say I have data from a bunch of transactions. I buy items and then resell them for a profit. So I have 4 main inputs for each transaction - 1)the amount of time it took me to buy the item, 2)the price I bought it for (relative to its market price, e.g. 0.97 or 97%), 3)the amount of time it took me to sell the item, 4)the price i sold it for (e.g. 103% of market price).\n\nSo basically I'm looking for an algorithm that can tell me what buy price and what sell price should give me the most profit per unit of time. If I buy very low, I may make more profit off the transaction but it will take longer to find a seller. Same with selling - if I sell too high it will take a long time. I need to find that sweet spot.\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jordan Shackelford", "cid": "Ugiu8KubIhyotngCoAEC"},

{"text": "First you would have to find out if you can apply machine learning to the problem. In some cases there is not much correlation between features and the model has low accuracy for prediction purposes. I am more familiar with the R package randomForest. Here I would say you have to aim at at least an accuracy of 80% to consider the model tuned and optimal to draw predictions.\n\nIf you have historical data about the dependent and independent variables I can look at it for you in R and tell you if the problem is fit for prediction analysis\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "loza_pl", "cid": "Ugiu8KubIhyotngCoAEC.8JT1Wus9g5c8Jx2I5ZMnnv"},

{"text": "As a first thought, I have an easy way to solve this.\n\nThere are two sweet spots that we would like to find. One is the sellPrice per unit of time. The other is the buyPrice per unit of time.\nI\u2019ll explain my solution for sellPrice. Then for buyPrice it is just the same idea.\n\nFirst, generate a new column in your dataset \u201csellPricePerUT\u201d calculated as sellPrice/sellTime. So each sellPrice,sellTime pair will have a corresponding sellPricePerUT.\n\nSecond, plot a graph of sellPricePerUT versus sellPrice. I think the problem is getting clearer to you here. We want to sell at a high \u201cprice per unit of time\u201d. So we just want to maximize sellPricePerUT.\nAt this point, you still cannot make conclusions because you might have multiple points over each other so you need to account for that.\n\nSo third, perform polynomial regression where you have a single input feature \u201csellPrice\u201d and a single output feature \u201csellPricePerUT\u201d. Draw the graph with the regression curve.\n\nConclusion Step: You can now look at the graph and observe the local and global maximum/maxima. Look at the X axis to see the sellPrice that corresponds to the maximum value. If you want to be accurate you can use a function that finds the maxima of your regression curve.\n\nFor buyPrice, you just need to look for the minimum buyPricePerUT instead of the maximum.\n\nBy the way, can you share the data set with me?\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Abdul Rahim Haddad", "cid": "Ugiu8KubIhyotngCoAEC.8JT1Wus9g5c8LcFAqizcSC"},

{"text": "Depends on if you want to learn ML at a practical level or at an academic level. If you plan on getting good enough at ML to get a job in the field then you'll want to take the practical route, but if you want to learn ML just for the sake of understanding it or doing research then you'll want to go the academic route. Andrew's lectures are highly academic and focus a lot on the mathematical and statistical aspects of ML so unless you have a solid foundation of statistics and linear algebra basics you'll struggle to keep up. Additionally, if you follow his lectures on Coursera then you'll want to learn MATLAB as well as that's the programming language used there. MATLAB is great for prototyping when coming up with your own ML scenarios or algorithms but it's not all that practical for field work (i.e developing an ML application, gathering and managing massive amounts of data, etc.). But the good thing about Andrew's lectures is that he's incredibly well versed in the subject and could explain its concepts much better than almost anyone else I've found online. If you get through one of his courses you'll have a thorough understanding of how most ML algorithms work and that'll form a solid foundation for practical application.\n\nHowever, if you want to study ML for the sake of deploying applications or getting a job then there are other available courses online which focus heavily on getting you to apply ML to real world scenarios as soon as possible. One such series is Google's own newly started Intro to Machine Learning (https://goo.gl/lIuJb2). They use Python to get you up and running coding your first ML program asap. However, the series is not complete and they are still adding to it at the time of writing. Another great source, in my opinion, is Sentdex's tutorials (https://goo.gl/RteOHz). He has a large number of tutorial series focused on implementing ML using Python which are aimed at solving practical, everyday problems like stock market predictions. These tutorials mainly focus on using already-available Python libraries (such as Sklearn and MatPlotLib) to implement ML algorithms instead of trying to build them from scratch. Mastering Sklearn and similar libraries will enable you to land an ML job much more quickly, but if you don't follow through with the academic side then you'll be left implementing a bunch of pre-written algorithms that you don't quite understand.\n\n\"Another good tip I got was to continue with reading some book on machine learning\"\n\nGood tip indeed,  you may want to find an ML book which uses the language of your choice, though if you are going to enter the fields of ML and data science Python and R are outright expected of you. One suggestion I can make is Machine Learning for Hackers by Drew Conway and John Myles White which uses R, if you want Python there's Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran , It'll help you get started but I've heard that the second book has become outdated because it uses outdated API's for pulling data from various sites. \n\n\"picking a problem there that seemed fun\"\n\nAlmost any problem becomes fun with ML but the real challenge, which is constant across all problems, is the pains of acquiring data, labelling data, formatting data, normalizing data, etc so that your algorithm can properly parse it.\n\n\"create a machine learning algorithm\"\n\nWouldn't recommend you start implementing your own ML algorithms at this early stage, instead get to know the existing ML techniques and understand how they work, take them apart and see what each part, each variable does. Pretty much all problems you'll encounter in the real world will fall into an already defined category such as Clustering, Labelling etc, each having its own set of ML algorithms that best suite the occasion. (Here is a nifty little chart which can help you pick an appropriate algorithm: https://goo.gl/yMKQt6). These algorithms are highly optimized and quick, much better than anything we could implement manually. However, if you do encounter a problem where the existing algorithms fail to deliver a satisfactory result then you can look into forming your own ML algorithms, but this is more or less heavily research oriented. \n\nHope this long post was of some help to you and good luck :)\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Imitation Krabs", "cid": "UgiNKOntAAH8ongCoAEC.8Ijkh3MHYAF8IqqA9wMb5E"},
