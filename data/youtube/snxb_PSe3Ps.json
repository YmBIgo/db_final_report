{"text": "You know there is a better way to make your Sauerkraut. Take your wide mouth quart mason jars pack them with cabbage , add 1TBS canning salt, 1TBS cider vinegar you don't have to mix it in the cabbage, \u00a0top them up with cold water and then put the ring lids on. Not to tight you want the gas to be able to escape! You then place 6-8 jars in the bottom of a clean 50 gal plastic trash can. You then place another layer, careful sitting the second layer on the first layer \u00a0and finale place 3 rd layer of jars on top of the second layer. \u00a0You should have 3 layer with about 24-36 jars in your 50 gal trash can. \u00a0The next step is to fill the trash can with water so that it covers the jars I like to fill the water up till it just covers each layer as you load them in put the trash can lid on . Place it in cool place and leave it alone for 21 days. Just walk away. \u00a0 \u00a021 days later \u00a0pull the jars out, tighten the lids down and place them in cool dark place. It will be good for about 8-12 months the longer it sits the sour it gets. My grand mother taught me how to make it when I was about 16. You don't have worry about skimming anything or make sure the cabbage stay under the juice. Once in awhile you will get a little scum on the surface of the water in the trash can, \u00a0just skim it off the surface of the water.\ufeff", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "Daniel Edmondson", "cid": "UgwPt1ekR8teR39jQNV4AaABAg"},
