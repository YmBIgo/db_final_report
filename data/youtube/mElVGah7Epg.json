{"text": "As much as I respect you, I have to disagree with your statement that says you should learn asking for help. That asking for help is more often than not the worst choice sometimes when learning programming. Programming is all about that motivation to correct all those small mistakes and make that damn code run properly, even if the problems are difficult to solve. If you try to fix the problematic code by yourself, it may take you longer to make progress, but after fixing a mistake for half an hour and then finally finding the solution, you are gonna train your brain,  catch some extra knowledge while you're at it, and the solution you've been searching for for so long is guaranteed to learn you not to repeat the same mistake again.\ufeff", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Lukas O.", "cid": "UgzSUge0ZYNhvyy0MFZ4AaABAg"},

I will tell you this: You WILL NEVER learn code if you only follow what you figure out from anyone, until you have understood and can make examples and solve them for yourself. However, YOU NEED to ask for help. Not only is help a good way to work backwards from a solution, but it is an excellent way to find different methods and styles of coding that suit you and expand your knowledge/ability to think outside of the box. I am simultaneously learning excellent theory and a rigorous amount of practice. It is absolutely amazing.....by far.\ufeff", "time": "8 hours ago", "author": "Matthew Jones", "cid": "UgzSUge0ZYNhvyy0MFZ4AaABAg.8a7R6hyaqPs8bMCsLvOlvG"},
