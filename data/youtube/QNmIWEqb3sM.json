I think the kind of person that seeks to take an IQ test will likely know already they have a relatively high IQ. The kind of person that seeks a high score will more often be a high achiever, thus eventually attain success. Most people with a normal level of motivation will have passing interest in their IQ. The score itself can also change over the course of your life. The most famous IQ scores for geniuses will be determined after they have achieved success. I wouldn't be surprised if many of them had an average score in the years leading up to their success.\n\nI suppose that if you enforced an IQ test on everybody you would surprised to know just how many normal people have a 120+ rating. For me personally, I went through a stage where I was impressed with my higher then average IQ. But, in hindsight the test really means nothing. Your actions are what counts, not an engineered test that makes a vague estimate of human intellect. The test is an effective guide to determine learning disabilities for very low IQ scores, but for an average person outside of medical diagnosis your intellect is more complex then a singular number, and based on the context of what you do.\ufeff", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Sam", "cid": "UgxTMydYTSY9744CGER4AaABAg.8YtawMGSvkR8_kYiYv6JD1"},

A typical person who goes through all the education and works 50-60 hour work weeks (as Musk has stated he expects from those under him) certainly deserves more than they earn.

And often doesn't end up putting much investment in areas that don't matter at the moment, but will in the future. Prime example being the energy sector which has remained largely stagnant since the 80s. \n\n   If we go by how true value is determined (productivity, efficiency + labor time) we can make an educated guess and say a SpaceX engineer, or aerospace engineer in general deserves more than their market value. Market value of course being a measure of demand and scarcity in one moment of time.
