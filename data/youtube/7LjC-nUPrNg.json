Now imagine an ambitious person who could rally the people, overthrow the Kim Dynasty, open the 38th parallel, establish trade with SK allow the import of food and resources, external scientists, botanist etc. Allow outside technology and minds to find ways to grow more food....etc. You could take a country on the brink of starvation and death (NK) and turn it into a country like its southern neighbor (south korea), which happens to be one of the fastest growing and tech. advanced countries in the world, and is right next door.

They buy expensive food and shoot film of kids reacting to it so they can get views, thumbs up/down, and subscribers which pads their funding from youtube.

However, I think there would be something lost in feeding wagyu cheesesteak to starving kids too...  Serious implications about exploitation of starving children for youtube hits...  and, I'm pretty sure the primary viewership is looking for a \"feel good\" experience from their channel and not \"aw, this is both nice and horribly depressing at the same time.\"  I don't think that's what they're going for.\n\nIt would be nice to see bon appetite sponsoring a food drive or fund raiser for feeding starving children around the world... But, I really don't want them pandering for money from me...
