They get the thank you email, yes, but they get the product they want. \nSo basically, Kickstarter is giving the people a chance to invest into something they really want, not into something that rich people want and that is constrained by the financial system and the market. The Kickstarter concept is actually an indicator of what is wanted on the market, and what is not.\nEven more, it's reversing the process. Instead of companies investing money in a product, and then investing into marketing for that product (which helps in selling shitty products that are basically everywhere now), you have companies offer to make something, and people 'vote' for that product by lending money. \nSo no, Kickstarter all the way.

People should be free to borrow, lend, risk money, etc. as they see fit so long as they are willing to suffer the consequences when they make wrong mistakes. Government shouldn't be there to bail them out. Government also shouldn't be spending more than tax revenue brings in and it shouldn't be allowed to borrow. Personally, I don't believe you should buy anything unless you have the money up-front. I'm not going to buy a home, buy a car, start a business, or anything else unless I have the money up-front to afford it. However, I also would never ban other people from borrowing.

Those only use barter when dealing (rarely) with total strangers - if there's any level of mutual trust within a community, they just figure someone will get them back at some point.\n\nMaybe this widespread barter idea is so believable because we do buy most things we buy off total strangers, but we live in a pretty unusual age in the grand scheme of things.\ufeff", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Adeclaration", "cid": "Ugj-pCn07L37y3gCoAEC"},

Because money is defined as something that 1) stores value 2) is a unit of exchange and 3) can be used as measure for relative value. One example: Person A borrows from Person B two dollars. Person A gets money (two dollars) and Person B gets an IOU which states \"you get two dollars later\". These are 4 dollars in total. Why? Because Person B can sell the IOU for two dollars which means that the IOU 1) stores value, 2) can be used as unit of exchange and 3) can be used as a measure for relative value which is the definition of money.

Banks basically supplanted PD with BC, which makes BC the de facto currency and BC creation de facto money creation (even  though no PD is created).\n\n\nAnother quirk of fractional reserve banking is that creation of addition BC dilutes the real value of each individual BC, and since we accept BC as PD, the real value of PD also goes down. So the additional purchasing power from the new BC comes from all existing BC+PD, which then the banks charge interest on.

Now the bank has $1000(PD), A has a car plus $4000 of debt and B has $5000(BC). A $5000 purchase occurred even though only $1000(PD) existed.\n\n\nAlso the $4000 debt is not the same as $-4000(BC).

Since you can only exchange 1PD for 1BC, things are more expensive, which has the same effect as printing more PD.\n\nAs for having multiple banks which deal with each other in PD, all you need is scale. In a model where bank clients uniformly select other bank clients and sends that person a random amount of money (with or without loans), for any pair of banks, the mean net PD transfer is 0 and more importantly the variance of the net PD transfer decreases with the number of transactions. In the long term, the amount of PD each bank holds remains constant, while still being able to issue more BC.

Also, employees in a competitive industry such as fast food\u00a0are already\u00a0paid their marginal revenue product as a result of market competition; i.e., the employer is a price-taker, and the marginal product of the worker is determined by the worker deciding how hard and efficiently he wishes to work, thus the employer has no real say in what the wage is (mathematically: w = p*MPL = MRPL).
