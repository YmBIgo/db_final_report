The Americans With Disabilities Act really did help people with visible disabilities, especially those in wheelchairs get around and made sure they had access to public spaces.  However, the law requires that employers offer 'reasonable accommodations' for their disabled workers. The ADA also made illegal employment contracts that benefitted some disabled people and employers--employment contracts between talented but severely disabled employees and their employers, where the employer was providing accommodations that went beyond 'reasonable'.   There are brilliant minds out there, who are trapped in badly functioning bodies, who might think great thoughts and get published, only if employers were willing to provide accommodations that went beyond 'reasonable' (such as judging performance by output of useful ideas, adjusting teaching loads / team teaching classes and seminars, extremely liberal sick leave, etc.)--accommodations Dr Hawking enjoys.\ufeff", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Bonny D.", "cid": "UgiaEt1fC-y_TngCoAEC"},

Despite his profound disability I am happy to assume his cognitive function is not impaired because that is not what I meant.\n\nRather - I am pointing out that his ability to express thoughts (however clear those thoughts may be) is what's extremely impaired.\n\nSurely you'd agree that it would have required vastly longer for \"Stephen Hawking\" to have written your 88 word reply than was needed for you to write it. Hopefully that can help to illustrate the point I am making. That if anyone in this world were to benefit from a \"ghost writer\" it would definitely be \"Stephen Hawking\"!\n\nWhile I can only speculate as to why a \"ghost writer\" would write through \"Stephen Hawking\" - whoever does so would have their words backed by a widely held belief they had came from the \"world's most intelligent person\".\n\nAsk random people in the street to name \"the world's most intelligent person\" and many would reply, \"Albert Einstein\". Ask them to name the world's most intelligent person who is still alive and many would reply, \"Stephen Hawking\".\n\nI hope you won't dispute the reality that many more people know of \"Stephen Hawking\" as a \"genius\" than they do for his works.\n\nThere is much to gain from such a reputation (and I won't dispute it is deserved).\n\nFor example - should I tell people that the \"universe functions like a dream\" it may be ignored. After all - who is \"Lesta\"? But should \"Stephen Hawking\" tell people that the universe functions like a dream - it can end up having a profound impact on people and their thinking.\n\nNot only does \"Stephen Hawking\" benefit from a ghost writer but whoever gets to write his words will also be enormously benefited.\ufeff", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Lesta Nediam", "cid": "UgitlKmcGn9mvXgCoAEC.8V7H22XHhU68V_v-_ZdWtO"},
{"text": "Lesta Nediam ok I see what you're saying. I think the fundamental misunderstanding here is that he talks in real time. It takes him time to speak. It's faster now as his system has improved. His system uses an advanced predictive text algorithm and can essentially guess what he's going to say next. Think of it like the one on android and iPhone, only far better at guessing his next words as it's catered specifically to him and runs on a much more powerful system. As for his influence, he has it for a reason. People listen to him because he's an immensely intelligent man with the credentials to back it up. If some random guy told me that black wholes emit radiation that doesn't match the patterns of the matter consumed by said black hole, I'd be skeptical. As a science enthusiast myself, I take whatever is said to me with a grain of salt. My motto is \"trust,  but verify\". Even when Stephen announced this idea I was skeptical until I saw his research and the research of others. There's a reason we trust him and put so much importance on what he says. Would it be easier for him to have a ghost writer? Yeah probably. But much like using google translate to write in another language, it would be difficult for anyone to translate what is going on in his mind properly and give it justice. I encourage you to watch some of his lectures and see what he's all about. I can say with 95 percent certainty that he writes and says everything straight from his chair.\ufeff", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "August Break", "cid": "UgitlKmcGn9mvXgCoAEC.8V7H22XHhU68V_yhD6ezp8"},

{"text": "+August Break __ While there are some who think \"Stephen Hawking\" is communicating in real time - most understand that \"Stephen Hawking\" does not actually \"speak\" in real time.\n\nEverything we hear him \"speak\" comes from prepared responses that were written in advance. I.e., his team are given interview questions in advance and the interview is conducted after the responses have been written.\n\nLet's talk about his interviews since \"Stephen Hawking\" does quite a few of them and - more importantly - gives his opinion in them.\n\nBecause \"Stephen Hawking\" gives his opinion in interviews it is important that we are hearing his opinion and not the opinion of someone else (e.g., a ghost writer).\n\n(By the way, have you seen the recent interview he did with \"Piers Morgan\"?)\n\nSince writing responses to basic/common interview questions is an area where a \"ghost writer\" would not need to be a \"genius\" the use of one would be a great time-saver.\n\nI too like the motto \"trust but verify\" and it certainly applies to this matter. You mentioned that the predictive text system \"Stephen Hawking\" utilises is sophisticated and fast. I don't doubt that it is.\n\nBut have you ever seen a demonstration of it? Wouldn't it be amazing to see the great \"Stephen Hawking\" do his thing?!\n\nI think if there were footage of \"Stephen Hawking\" actually using the technology to compose sentences there would be no need to verify what we are most definitely having to trust!\n\nWhile it all sounds plausible enough - there does not appear to be any practical demonstration of the technology being used by ALS sufferers let alone able-bodied people. That's not to say it doesn't work but that the speed may not be nearly as fast as you have been led to believe.\n\nUntil we see a demonstration of able-bodied people composing sentences by twitching a cheek muscle at a pace that doesn't lose out to a snail I think it's fair for us to remain skeptical.\n\nOf course - no one doubts that \"Stephen Hawking\" can compose sentences using his device but to think he can write as much as he does and keep on top of his field is a stretch.\n\nDoesn't the use of a ghost writer begin to make more sense?\n\nEven if there is a 10% chance of \"Stephen Hawking\" using a ghost writer that should make us incredibly wary of any \"opinions\" we hear \"Stephen Hawking\" giving. For how can we be sure they are his own?\n\nAh - for that we must trust but we should also verify!\ufeff", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Lesta Nediam", "cid": "UgitlKmcGn9mvXgCoAEC.8V7H22XHhU68Va4yMn-XWO"},

{"text": "It's sad that so many people suffer from ALS, but don't know there's a cure. A company in the US founded by 2 doctors probably over 20 years ago found what causes ALS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, Tourette's, and a few other genetic diseases. It is caused by a defective ATP7b gene that was identified after mapping the genome. It's the same gene that causes Wilson's disease and there are over 400 mutations of this gene that have been discovered. When a person has this defective gene, copper does not adequately bind to ceruloplasmin protein, which causes toxic unbound or free copper to build up in the body. In a normal person, copper is bound to ceruloplasmin and evacuated through the bile duct and out the stool. When this free copper builds up, many people have little to no problems for\u00a0most of their life, because their brain is protected by the blood brain barrier. When they get older their blood brain barrier deteriorates and the toxic free copper enters their brain and short circuits it. Eventually they become paralyzed because the brain signals to their muscles are blocked by the free copper in their brain. In cases of schizophrenia where the average onset is age 21, they are born with a defective blood brain barrier and one of the mutations that are milder, if you could call it that, where the body is still binding some copper. There are 6 binding exons on the gene and in some mutations 4 are working and only 2 are not binding. Some have 5 binding and 1 not binding. In the most severe mutations, where none of the 6 are binding copper, the person usually dies of childhood liver failure. This accounts for the many different mutations and their degrees of severity. Wilson's disease is still thought of as a childhood liver disease and most doctors know nothing of the 400 mutations, many not even affecting the liver. They also know nothing of free copper and its discovery after the genome was mapped. Many have never even heard of Wilson's disease, because there are thousands of genetic diseases and there is not enough time in medical school to learn about even a fraction of the diseases. If someone brings it to their attention and they look it up in their outdated medical books, it will say it's a childhood liver disease. I hate to burst your bubble, but doctors are not all knowing entities like many people think. The cures have been hidden from them by big Pharmaceutical companies. One way to cure this problem that Hawking has, is a liver graft from a healthy family member that doesn't have the copper binding problem. Even without a liver graft, a person with ALS, that is in the condition of Hawking's can have chelation treatment and once their copper levels are brought down, they can eventually get back to normal. They will most likely need to learn to talk and walk again, but they can be successfully treated with chelation treatment. After chelation treatment they will need to take zinc daily to block the copper from being absorbed from the food they eat and building back up. Most likely, Hawking was born with a defective blood brain barrier and had this defective ATP7B gene, to get this at such a young age, because most ALS patients come down with the disease after age 50, when the blood brain barrier starts deteriorating. I'm writing this in case someone has a family member with one of these free copper diseases. They can get on a chelation drug called ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TM) and in 8 weeks be de coppered. In 2 weeks they will be brought to a non toxic copper level. Big Pharma makes billions per year treating these diseases and they don't want anyone to know there's a cure. Big Pharma has a history of blocking cures from entering the Universities where the doctors are trained. They control the curriculum and teach them to only\u00a0treat these conditions with their medicine they sell.\ufeff", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "shooting shark", "cid": "UggIxf0oEc_WbXgCoAEC"},

{"text": "D-B-A , That condition can be caused by excess copper and it's probably why the vitamin C helped out, because high doses of vitamin C has been shown to chelate copper. You should go have a blood test and have your free copper checked. There are 2 ways to measure your free copper. The first method is to have your serum copper tested and your ceruloplasmin protein tested. You take the ceruloplasmin level and multiply it by 3 and then subtract it from your serum copper, which will give you your free copper level. This is called an indirect measurement of free copper. The 2nd method a relatively new way of testing copper and it's a lab test called direct measurement of free copper. Just the serum copper level test alone won't tell you anything, and you'll have to tell the doctor that you want your free copper level tested, because he most likely never heard of free copper. If he tests your serum copper level and it's in the normal range, he'll say you have no problem, but don't believe him, insist that you want your free copper level tested. The serum copper is just a measurement of your total copper, bound and unbound to ceruloplasmin protein. In a normal person 90 to 95% should be bound to ceruloplasmin and 5 to 10% should be unbound or free copper. The bound copper is totally safe and actually used by the body, it's the unbound that is toxic and causes problems when it gets too high. It's the equivalent of a heavy metal when it's unbound or free and causes all kinds of problems. If you have a higher than normal level of free copper, the best way to lower it is to take 50 mg of zinc 3 times a day, one hour before meals or 2 hours after meals. If you take zinc with food it binds it up and it is not as effective. How zinc gets out copper is by setting up metallothionein protein in the gut, which has an affinity for copper. It latches on to the copper\u00a0in the blood through the intestinal cells, and then every 8 days the cells turnover and form new ones. The copper goes out the stool with the metallothionein laced cells and the process starts all over with the new cells. Zinc is slow, but effective and one of the safest ways to chelate copper. Don't ever take the old copper chelator, D penacillamine, because it has some horrific side effects and has turned people into vegetables. It is so aggressive at mobilizing the copper from the tissue that it floods the body and brain with massive amounts of copper. The copper is not bound to metallothionine like it is with zinc, and you'll get a lot of copper coming through your kidneys which is not good.

{"text": "Violet Heroine - There are tons of sources. You can google Pipex Pharmaceuticals and their research scientists that tested patients in an Alzheimers home and found them all to have above normal free copper levels. You can look at the now retired, Dr. George Brewer that was treating people with neurological Wilson's disease and noticed that the symptoms were identical to ALS. He took people that had been misdiagnosed with ALS, tested their free copper\u00a0and re diagnosed them with neurological Wilson's disease and successfully treated them, where they got back to normal. You can look at Dr. Carl C Pfeiffer, that cured, or successfully treated 20,000 schizophrenics by lowering their copper with zinc. Once their copper was lowered they lived a normal life free of medication and as long as they stayed on the zinc, they remained cured, or successfully treated. His research showed, if they stopped the zinc, they would eventually relapse. Pfeiffer discovered the cure for schizophrenia back in the 1960's and according to him, the big Pharma spent millions discrediting his research and keeping it out of the medical schools where psychiatrists were being trained. They were, and still are making billions on these psychiatric drugs and a cure will cost them a lot of money. All of these free copper diseases are basically Wilson's disease mutations. There are over 400 mutations that have been discovered since the genome was map and most don't even affect the liver, but the outdated medical books say Wilson's disease is a childhood liver disease. When Pipex discovered the causes of these diseases, they didn't waste time trying to convince everyone that these were really Wilson's disease mutations, they just applied for usage patents to treat each one of these diseases with a drug they developed to lower copper levels. Since all of that happened, Pipex has been bought out by one company and then that company was bought out by another, and the FDA is dragging their feet at approving what they want. Most likely the big pharmaceutical companies are putting a stop to this information, because they would lose billions.\ufeff", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "shooting shark", "cid": "UggIxf0oEc_WbXgCoAEC.8Up3dWxZOBb8V4Hf_ftBNJ"},

I don't care what that scientist on TV said, if he knows so much about Alzheimer's why hasn't he cured or successfully treated anyone and got them back to normal? If that yoyo knew anything about plaque, he'd know they're called amyloid plaques and he'd also know that elevated copper has been found to exist in these plaques.

How do you think new treatments are designed, tested and spread? What do you think journals are intended to do? What do you think pharmaceutical companies intend to do? You don't think they'd be selling the cure if they had one?\n\nDo you also believe cancer has a cure but pharmaceutical companies are keeping it up their sleeve for the right time to sell it?\n\nSorry for the great deal of questions, but I'd be very interested to see exactly how pathologically delusional you are.\n\nAnswer key in case you legitimately can't figure it out:\nResearch papers are meant to distribute the knowledge gained from whatever kind of experiment was done within that research. In the case of a successful treatment of a major disease, such a research paper will usually be published in a prestigious journal and garner much attention from professionals who read that journal from all over the world.

{"text": "You believe in God because you were raised as a Muslim. That's why you believe. You were told to. As an adult you can think for yourself and therefore you are have developed your own ideas about space, time and extra dimensions. However, since you were raised as a Muslim and Islam makes up an important part of your self identity, you have restricted your thinking to a bias towards a belief in God. Your self identity is important to you. It's also very strong. What benefit do you have by losing that strong sense of who you are? None. Even if people call you stupid for your ideas you don't care. You simply believe they are blind and do not know the truth.\n\nBut the truth is, everything you believe you believe to protect the belief that was passed down to you by your parents. This is what religion does. Even as you read this you can sense that I am attempting to poke holes in your beliefs and therefore you probably see me as misguided and ignorant. \n\nThe issue is, think about what the claim actually is from Islam or Christianity, etc. The claim is that an intelligence created reality and one of the things the intelligence did was create torture chamber (hell). The intelligence creates a paradise too and conscious beings to dwell in it (human beings). However, as a \"test\" the intelligence  puts humans on earth and decides that those who fail the test end up in the torture chamber. The intelligence even allows for dark forces (Satan) to try and mislead the humans. \n\nThe issue is that the intelligence is all wise and all knowing. Therefore everything that happens is a result of the will of the intelligence. It created a torture chamber and it set off a chain of events that would ensure it would get to use it. Life on earth is not a test. The intelligence knew who would pass and who would fail before the world was even created. The intelligence could have designed things to be different if they wished. \n\nGood and evil under this belief is just a pantomime.\ufeff", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "Smoking Horsey", "cid": "UggEBYcmQZhRU3gCoAEC.8Unoxsl9zVW8UoO0fmRkhT"},
