Much like the Hobbit is different to the Lord of the rings.\nLord of the Rings was a Trilogy that was filmed with a single vision and a longer time to film. It has perfect music, amazing battles, amazing acting.  Everything was done to the best that it could have been done. \nThe source material was also much larger allowing for more detailed scenes. The Hobbit had to stretch things out by comparison over 3 movies. There was so much content in Lord of the Rings that the movies were all 3 or 4 hours long. \n\nThe first time i watched Lord of the Rings was over the course of three nights. By the end of them i was almost crying when Frodo had to leave the shire he once loved so much. I didnt get that same level of emotional investment in the Hobbit. \nEven the music from Lord of the Rings makes me feel sad and nostalgic. \n\nI enjoyed parts of the Hobbit, but i felt that certain things were overdone and went over the top for comedic effect.\n\nWhen it comes down to it you have to look at the source material and compare them. Lord of the Rings was always going to be a better movie. It just had that much better story to work with. I think it was always going to be a disappointment when the Hobbit came out. We all wanted more Lord of the Rings and put our expectations at that level.

Shame that Peter Jackson or anyone involved couldn't come up with any comeback to give them more time at least. This is why I hate big studio reps and anyone else involved. I get that money makes more, but not when creativity and passion are pushed aside for value of less. The films still made money so I am sure the studios were satisfied either way regardless of how badly the films resulted in the end. What could have been the real The Hobbit movies. I am not saying this is the reason why other Middle Earth stories can probably never make it to the big screen, but if I were the family of Tolkien I would definitely not want anyone to touch any of the other stories after the insult that was The Hobbit trilogies.\ufeff", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Eduardo Alvarado Guzman", "cid": "Ugj_mqWU_v89lngCoAEC.8T30yTLsNnC8VPcVi00Mof"},

{"text": "It's clear these films were ruined by the commercial restrictions of modern film making.  I hope that one day there is an opportunity for someone to take more care over the amazing work Tolkien committed much of his life to. Maybe in a TV series sort of like Game of Thrones.....but even that has suffered, becoming worse and worse the more popular it gets IMO. I think there is a point where a story/idea/brand is so popular that the financial backers behind modern movies/series can't resist the temptation to force film directors and their teams to create rushed content in order to maximize their profits. \n\nIt's business getting in the way of art...I've worked in CGI and Graphic content for about 7 years now and I've noticed how technology has been getting better and better allowing one person to achieve a similar amount of work that used to take a team of about 5-20 people. With increased automation of production techniques I wonder whether one day it may be possible to create great content without needing to get financial backing from the sort of people who caused the Hobbit films to be so awful. Perhaps one day fans of such content could crowd source and create the content themselves via an open source production pipeline that could see all the works of Tolkien visualized over generations. I'd love to see the whole of LOTR and The Hobbit done chapter by chapter, maybe made into a comic book/storyboard then slowly over time committed to film. This could all be made possible by technology evolving to allow teams of people & fans pooling their skills all over the world to create the content they've always wanted to see. \n\nAs an example look at Blender 3D. It is a full 3D content creation tool with much of the technology used to create modern films built into it. It was entirely crowd funded and is free to anyone to use and learn. Coders from all over the world contribute to it every day and have done so for over 10 years. Due to it's freedom from the complications of needing to make money to appease shareholder etc the focus is just on creating a great tool for artists....IMO it's better than some of the paid 3D software.\n\nAlso look at a lot of the great mods created over the years for computer games....often they can be better and more well thought out than big commercial releases. There is power to peoples collective ability if properly organized and if you get talented people who actually love the content and who aren't being driven solely by a desire to make money, we as human beings could make beautiful things. Unfortunately it is money that is required to free a lot of talented people from their lives within the rat race. Maybe i'm not just explaining the pitfalls of modern film making but also the pitfalls of life for regular people in a society that is a slave to money.

Then:\n\n\"Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood.\" (- The Mirror of Galadriel)\n\nYou're misrepresenting what the text says regarding Sauron breaking L\u00f3rien's defence.\n\n\"Three times L\u00f3rien had been assailed from Dol Guldur, but beside the valour of the Elven people of that land, the power that dwelt there was too powerful for any to overcome, unless Sauron had come there himself.\" (- Appendix B)\n\nNot only is this confirming the Elven arms as a significant part of their defence, but it says that they would have fallen if Sauron had personally engaged them, and this is while Sauron was WITHOUT the Ring. Not being in possession of the Ring doesn't diminish Sauron, Tolkien categorically stated this.\n\nGildor and Elrond also had this to say during the Council of Elrond;\n\n\"What power still remains lies with us, here in Imladris, or with C\u00edrdan at the Havens, or in L\u00f3rien.

No storm, no ripping from the earth.

Tolkien himself explains the reason it has taken so long is because he is jealous of Gandalf. Galadrial thinks Gandalf should lead the White Council and Saruman seeks to undermine this opinion in any way possible. \nYou are entirely wrong in saying by this stage he was already working with Sauron. For one he had no communication with Sauron at all until he got hold of the Palintir. He was most certainly not in league with Sauron at all, what he is actually doing here is waiting for the one ring to present itself to Sauron, so that he may claim it for himself. A very important distinction. \nHis corruption was completed around the time of 3000 TA, or more specifically the process started when he started using the Palintir, this is a while after the events of the Hobbit. \nSaying Saruman wasn't corrupted is like saying Boromir or Isildur weren't either. They all wanted to use the ring to destroy Sauron. You can still be corrupt and have your own motives. \nFurthermore, Christopher Lee, a long time Tolkien super-fan and actual actor of Saruman said himself that he is a good man at this point, short of Tolkien's work which implies he was not yet evil at this stage, this is as good as it gets as to the state of mind of the character.\n\nEdit: I believe the actual words are something along the lines of Saruman is \"entrapped\" or \"ensnared\" by Sauron, with the use of the Palintir.\ufeff", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "Dr Rick Marshall", "cid": "Ugj_SIUZXUlShngCoAEC.8S6d3owJa7I8_5h_BXz4Mm"},

{"text": "Alexander McGrath just to add. Saruman did most of the work of driving sauron out of dul godor. Galdriel didnt have enough of an impact. I love this scene for the nazgul and sauron vs the white council but tolkien never said the nazgul appeared. And he didnt give galadriel the lead role. Saruman felt from his victory he would need more power to vanquish sauron which lead to his obsession with finding the ring which he still shows that. So even though peter jackson tweeked the battle alot it still followed the main plot and i still enjoy this scene. And to add, i love how the intensity of their magic comes from vocal enchantment and not out of some wand. Really gives you the feel that using magic in middle earth is not meant to be abused unless you dont mind ending up nameless, faceless, and formless\ufeff", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Daniel Silva", "cid": "Ugg9-fSU9n4tOHgCoAEC.8CmY7a1FCdh8YS5PNxF6p7"},
