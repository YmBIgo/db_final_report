It was trade off of sorts. \n\nMicrosoft paid Apple for some rights (with the license really tied to giving MS early access to develop apps for the Mac), and Apple filed suit over the MS implementation since they interpreted the license as limited, while Microsoft exploited it as unlimited and Apple screwed up the dating in the agreement expecting an earlier ship date.
