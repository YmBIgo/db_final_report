{"text": "Why is the first question people want to know is if something is hard or not? Are you not capable of doing something if it's not easy? So what if coding is difficult or not? Stop being afraid to take challenges people. We as humans always try to find the easiest solution to everything, instead of challenging our minds and making any real effort. No one wants to spend long hours trying to solve a difficult problem. Instead we'd rather have it handed to us or have it put in a way that doesn't take any real effort for us to use our brains to figure out. Stop always wanting to do something that makes you feel safe and secure. Stop doing things that don't leave you room to fail and do something that takes you out of your comfort zone.  So what if you fail, what's stopping you from trying again until you finally find the solution? You run from failure when making mistakes is the only way to get better. \n\nInstead we take on simple tasks that take no time and almost no willpower to complete and wonder why it's not a long lasting gratification when we complete them, when they didn't even take any real effort to begin with. How can we give someone our best, when we never  gave our best to begin with? Just like the saying  \"you are what you eat\", you only get what you put in.  You always take on things that don't challenge you, and think you did something but when it's time to put it into practice, you choke. \n\nIs coding for you? Instead of asking is coding hard, I think the real questions you should ask yourself are:\nAre you afraid of problem solving? Are you afraid of challenging the way people think? Do you put your  best foot forward to be the best you can be to not be average? Do you have a creative mind and think outside the box? If you answered no to any of these, then I think you've already found your answer.  Nothing great ever came by taking it easy all the time.\ufeff", "time": "4 days ago", "author": "Brittney Williams", "cid": "Ugw3AW70c4O9FKSK-K94AaABAg"},

{"text": "Hi random person scrolling through the comments,\nI just wanted to write this comment to tell you how to ACTUALLY learn how to code/program/develop/whatever. I am going to try to stay away from sounding like someone on /r/iamverysmart but the premise of programming/coding/etc kind of lends itself to be in that realm because of the nature of it. Anyway, I've taken every computer science/programming/etc course offered at my previous high school and I am currently studying software development/general programming in college and I work for a tech startup where I live. What got me first started on this world was playing \"Powder Game\" as a little kid, and thinking about the behind-the-scenes of how it worked. My dad introduced me to codeacademy, which I took a few basic courses on but never really fully got into it. That is the problem with sites like codingdojo or treehouse or codeacademy or Udemy or whatever other sites that have those Youtube ads of some random 20-something year old that \"learned programming/coding after X months\" - those sites don't actually teach you very much, at least, they didn't teach ME very much. The way I really got into coding was in high school when I took Pre-AP computer science freshman year. The class started me off in a really simple environment called \"Scratch\" that used drag-and-drop code to do certain functions. This really helped me get started because it taught me the basics of how code and functions work and work together. It also teaches the basics of variables and things like that. After scratch, the class transitioned into a basic language called VisualBasic and we used software called VisualStudio by Microsoft. This was a good software because it taught me about properties and really offered a good, comprehensive, but still basic enough to grasp coding environment. Next year, I took AP Computer Science A and this class started off with VisualStudio as well, but more advanced aspects of it. Later, we transitioned into NetBeans which is a development environment to learn Java. I would personally recommend starting with Java because a lot of languages build off Java like JavaScript and C#. Java is used for application development and the other two that I mentioned are used for game development primarily. After learning Java (For Loops, nested loops, if loops, while loops, recursion, arrays and 2D arrays) I chose to take Mobile app development and Principles of computer science AP the next year (Principles was a new class that year, I probably would have taken it freshman year otherwise). In Principles, I still learned a ton because the class was more heavily focused on how networking, cyphers, scamming and hacking, and other aspects of computers and networking, like packaging and IP's, IPV4 and IPV6 and such. This class was still incredibly beneficial. Mobile app development didn't teach much because the teacher was trash, but I did end up learning HTML (for those of you that don't know, HTML is used for making websites) because the teacher had us take a codeacademy class for it.\n\nAfter all of this, I went into animation and graphic design the next year because I had already taken every offered computer programming course. By the time I was a senior, I knew Java fluently and due to outside of class work on games in Unity I learned C# and Javascript fluently. I also knew HTML but only enough to make a really basic website. I personally preferred to make games and applications over websites so I was content. I moved into college after this and took high-level programming courses and software development courses that mainly talked about advanced mathematical computing and computational theory like quantum computing instead of basic coding stuff, but in my software engineering/development classes I did a lot more strict code and cloud-based software development and even got to work on AI development.\n\nI work in the tech startup right now because there was a job fair thing at my college and I talked to them and got hired eventually.\n\nSo, that's my story. Hopefully it helps you ACTUALLY learn how to code instead of this BS in the comments and the video above.\n\nFor takeaway, I suggest you determine the coding type (websites, game/application design/etc) that you most prefer, then find a language that suits that path best (quick note: if you like AI I suggest Java, though others will say differently). Also, if you haven't already missed your chance, TAKE CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL, it stimulates your coding skill and forces you to code weekly. (If your school offers it I also suggest taking OnRamps Statistics because it integrates coding into statistics).\n\nAnyway, I hope I helped. There are two kinds of computer programmers/coders, those who know a little bit of code theory and are asshats to you and pretend like they know everything and are kind of elite (this makes up like 85% of the community) and those who genuinely want to help you learn how to program, because they recognize the importance of it, like Mark Zuckerberg and such)\n\nand one last note, also try to find the IDE (Integrated Development Environment, like Netbeans or VIsualStudio mentioned above) that suits your path best. For me it is Unreal Engine and unity 5+\ufeff", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "ENRG Gaming", "cid": "UgxUNXjuw6LsloHQpkx4AaABAg"},

{"text": "9 years ago when i was in highschool, i took Visual Basic.

I think it was Java or C++. idk. But whatever i saw in that book confused me. So he suggested Visual Basics and so i did. \n\nAnd visual basic was really tough for me. \n\nI am not sure but i think even when my teacher first was solving a problem right in front of me, i don't think i had the idea on what coding was. And coding is basically lines of commands that a computer understands so you can solve a problem. I don't think i even understand that. I think even when my teacher was writing codes in front of me on that particular day, it never crossed my mind that i had to use codes. In other words, i was really clueless. I remember he was using the word \"dime\" because the assignment was on coins. And i believe that \"dime\" was something you have to use over and over again. I'm not sure. maybe i'm bullshitting this memory since i don't really remember. \n\nI do have to say tho that completing an assignment felt satisfying. And that is what i liked about coding. I didn't take it in college but tbh, as a 26 year old, i should go back and learn coding again.

Instead, you should be setting an expectation that students will struggle quite a lot before they grasp the concepts and that it's only easy once you get used to it. That encourages you to go through with the problems, even when they appear impossible to solve at first, and keep practicing until indeed you are comfortable with the materials. Telling someone what they are doing is easy is effectively saying \"if you struggle with it then you're an idiot because it's easy, and if you don't struggle with it you've hardly achieved anything because it's easy\".\ufeff", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "Ralph Schraven", "cid": "UgzTvRSMkzDl4W00DFR4AaABAg"},
{"text": "Programming isn't hard, but teaching programming is. As a PhD student I have teaching duties and had to give six lectures on basic programming in Matlab (I don't think that what language matter since most have the same basic concepts but with different syntax). Before I did that I thought that everyone could learn programming but now I have seen that some have a hard time to even understand that the content of a variable can be changed, or how to use a if statement. As one said in the video, learning how to program is like learning how to play an instrument, and anyone who have tried to learn an instrument knows that even the best have to practice every day which needs dedication.\ufeff", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Tor Dj\u00e4rv", "cid": "UgzG5f-wcEhu9BA3ZKd4AaABAg"},

{"text": "Mikkel Petersen whatever you need to believe in order to convince yourself that buying a Mac isn't just about following a trend that was created through good marketing and crappy business practices alone. Let me tell you a story anyone with Google can easily verify : if you have a powerful GPU on your Windows PC, you can't use it as a hardware accelerator in some famous video editing software I won't name. But if you use the same GPU on a Mac, then it works. The only difference is in the software's GPU plugins, and that difference is an arbitrary setting that favors Macs over PC's. This has led to people coming up with the \"hackintosh\" method, where you install MacOS on a PC by tricking it into thinking it's Apple hardware. Then you can use your GPU to its full extent on video editing. And everyone I know who's built a hackintosh from a PC ended-up with a Mac that outperformed Apple machines easily twice as expensive.\n\nSo, to recap, an arbitrary limitation in software is the basis on which some people claim Macs are better than PC's for video editing and therefore worth the huge price tag.

Well there is no rule that you can't. But you usually become a billionaire by being a successful businessman and of course learning code will help make a successful business. Don't get me wrong developer jobs can be very well paid but the myth of the successful coder who becomes a rich spoiled kid is very useful to attract potential recruits. Gates didn't become a billionnaire because he was a coding genius but because he bought DOS from another company and successfully marketed. Windows was then coded by a team not by a nerd in a garage. Maybe it reflected his amazing innovative vision of the future but he didnt become rich by typing lines of code. The same thing can be said of Facebook it was very well marketed. There were other solutions on the market that looked more interesting on paper when FB came out. Not saying FB is not at the cutting edge of web development but it has never really been a technical revolution. Sometimes it happened though.The guys who made Doom started by making games in their garage or more recently Notch the guy behind Minecraft. This said Notch wasn't the best programmer in the world but he managed to make a unique and popular game all by himself. And yeah the bottom line is those guy become billionnaires but there are usually not the guys making the code. But unless you learn coding you'll never know if you are the next guy who is going to find the idea that makes the bucks, or the guy who gets his idea stolen by the guy who makes the bucks :D\ufeff", "time": "4 days ago (edited)", "author": "Obiwan Kenobi", "cid": "Ugxa2RayNrA7P3_cs2h4AaABAg.8Z_TqfIpSKY8bAg9raZ4hH"},

You are always learning new things and as you get older, it gets harder to learn new skills and information and retain them . You need to be an excellent problem solver.  Most of your work will involve finding out why something is not doing what you want it to do. Everyday there is a new problem and even if you specialize in a certain area, technology will always change or new challenges will surface.  That's just the programming part.  You need to know about the domain, or what problem your program is trying to solve.  It could be literally anything,  If you're writing software for accountants, for instance,, you better know about accounting too.  If your writing a CAD module, you better know the math and the internals of the program the module will interface with.  Most programmers work in teams not to shorten the development time, but to spread out the cognitive load.\n\nDoctors only have to know about their specialty and will often refer patients to other specialists. Most of the stuff they learn in medical school is useless on the job.  Diagnosing conditions is easy  You follow a flow chart and you better follow it.

They do not.\n\nI am a retired programmer myself. I have a degree in Computer Hardware Architecture, one in Advanced Programming and one in Graphic Arts. I was originally going to work for Intel but as faith had it I met with a top developer and they paid for both the Programming and Graphic Arts degrees while I worked for them and climbed their ladder. \n\nBack to the original comment. \nA Coder knows how to write in the given programming language but they generally need some kind of guidance or instruction or supervision to do so. They are normally given tasks to do. Some kind of requested goal.\n\nA programmer on the other hand needs no supervision and brainstorms the logic and problem solving way before inputting 1 line of code. This takes many years of experience and further education to do so. It is a discipline.\n\nDevelopers (at least those I have worked with) tend to take their advice on what should be implemented in the software or what should be done from the programmer whereas with coders they are told what needs to be done.\n\nThose who spoke in this video are not ALL programmers. Coders yes. Programmers no. They got their breaks because they mostly were from wealthy families and they had connections in the business world and with promotions. This is a luxury not everyone has.

And you should too... and that skillset does not necessarily require a coding skill set.\ufeff", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Bhalesh Patel", "cid": "UgznVrl975s4ToSfgtF4AaABAg.8ZEdUgvEAXL8ZVk9cj0I0h"},
