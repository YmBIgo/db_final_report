Imagine being there when the internet was created and being able to make money from it. Cryptos right now are the same thing not because of the coins but the technology. My point is...You might look at Bitcoin or Ethereum or other coins and say they are too high in price...No...This is nothing. And for people new to this and want to try...Dont go for Bitcoin or Ether. Go for something newer like Wabi or Raiblocks or even newer and like Alpha said do your own reading. If you put 100 dollars on Bitcoin now you might make some dollars in a week but if you put 100 dollars on Wabi and it goes from 4 dollars a coin to 14 in a week...You make money.

{"text": "Quick education lesson from someone who has invested in bitcoin since 2011. The technology in bitcoin is not worth investing anymore. The price is far too high at this point to even make a profit as people have in the past. Lets say you hope to double up your money or more because you've heard all these stories about people making 10000x time their investment RIGHT?! well at this point, bitcoin is sooo overpriced at $13k (at the time im writing this comment) yes it was $20k a few weeks ago. Look everyone, at $13k PER bitcoin, you will need to have an entire bitcoin and then bank on the market to double to $26k per bitcoin just to double your money in todays market! That is an insane stretch just to double your investment. 2 weeks ago I bought $500 of bitcoin and immediately from the moment I bought it and then traded it to Bitrex ( a different crypto wallet exhange market) I lost $50 in fees alone and then it took 8hours just to reach Bitrex! A few days later I bought $500 in Etherum since both coins are on coinbase. I was charged only $4 between coinbase fees and transfer fees and it took 25mins to reach Bitrex! Im not here telling people to invest in etherum either but ALT-coins is where you wanna look for 95% of investors that read these fancy stories of get rich within a year or 2 stories thats creating all this hype. Cryptocurrency market cap is the website you wanna look at on a daily basis. Bitcoin is an amazing coin but it is past its time to invest into to sit on and make tons of money, its just over for that purpose. No coin would be possible today without bitcoins technology or hype but its time to look into etherum, ripple, litecoin, any ALT-coin. Hell, last year I threw $100 at ripple when it was worth .007C (thats not even a penny per ripple) and I got a large amount which people then were saying would take years to reach $1 but here we are and it hit $3 a week ago. Nobody knows what prices are going to look like. Ive heard bitcoin was gonna bubble at $1k, then it was 2K and then 3K and so on, now look it hit 20k and now its at 13k. The market is so unpredictable but bitcoin is sooo overpriced you wont make enough money to brag about at this point. I threw $20 at dogecoin (which everyone considers the JOKE of cryptos) a month ago when it was .0004 each and not its worth .01c which is huge gains but still extremely inexpensive. You dont need to break your bank with your investment, Just do a little research and take a guess and throw a reasonable amount of money at some alt-coins and wait out the roller coaster of ups and downs and see some major profits.

Already, the aggregate computing power of the bitcoin network is nearly 100,000 times larger than the world\u2019s 500 fastest supercomputers combined.\nThe total energy use of this web of hardware is huge\u2014an estimated 31 terawatt-hours per year.

Split up your investment into various different coins, not just all in on BTC, but some mid sized coins, LTC or ETH, and some smaller ones as ADA, IOTA and XMR.\nInvest the rest of your money into stocks. Here again, diversify: domestic (e.g. VTI), international (e.g. VEA), emerging markets (e.g. VWO), some dividends (e.g. VIG), and some natural resources (XLE) will build a good portfolio.\nBut before doing all that, max out your retirement plan, which often holds a tax advantage and an employer contribution, such as a 401k in the States.\n\nDon't expect to become millionaire in a day, that happens only to very few people.

I would be very careful about thinking this is just the beginning. This is the same crap people were saying just before the housing crisis. If there\u2019s anything to be said it\u2019s that anybody who didn\u2019t already own bitcoin have pretty much missed out.

{"text": "Do your own research, but in my opinion cryptocurrency right now is what the internet was a few decades ago. It made me more money than I could ever imagine at my age (not even close to being rich but still, I'm happy). A good tip is to look into SONM, it's the most advanced supercomputing network, far superior to Golem and such, and the best thing is that theyre not quite marketing their brand. As soon as big companies start using this technology, we'll see SONM turning into one of the biggest IT corporations in the world. Still, this is my educated opinion, so do your own research.\n\nThe best info sources right now are:\n* bitcointalk.org\n* twitter (follow as much big players and companies as possible (cryptocurrencynews, roger ver, charlee lee, John mcAfee (yes, follow him), every company you're interested in, ...)\n* the cryptolark/scrembo paul (great youtube channels)\n\nDo NOT listen to:\n* the guy you know from school that bought bitcoin 5 years ago and is telling you now how to get rich quick\n* banks (crypto can take down banking, no kidding)\n\nQuestions to ask yourself before investing:\n*If I lose this money or if it drops for a few weeks/months, would it bother me? No? Good, invest it.\n* Does the company I invest in have an experienced team, good advisors, a working prototype, an achievable goal, backing from big names, decent competition (no competition: either revolutionary tech OR people don't want it)\n* Am I chasing a train that has already left? Bitcoin isn't going to go x10 in a few months, but smaller coins like Stratis or Sonm could easily achieve that. Ask yourself what kind of results you're looking for, the longer you plan on holding your investment, the bigger the marketcap of the investment should be.\n\nThis is over a year of info, boiled down to a few sentences. If you're careful and you don't start chasing nice words and speeding trains, you'll make good money by following these tips.\ufeff", "time": "3 days ago (edited)", "author": "VJCS2411", "cid": "UgztXHXIbiMR-ouSfUJ4AaABAg"},

Just set a stop loss to automatically sell the coins when they drop below a certain threshold and exchange one coin into another when the coin  goes into a dip.

Multiply your bitcoin in 10 or so coins that are on the up and then when bitcoin starts moving upwards again put it back into bitcoin and set a stop loss for when bitcoin is back on the decline. You are basically always riding the waves upward this way. Anyone that says not to invest into crypto or even the stock market during a bullish period does not know what they are talking about.

{"text": "Great video :) Last summer I set on a path to get my finance game on point (as opposed to in the gutter) and then I started learning about cryptocurrencies back in September. I did it the hard way - I invested 2K and promptly lost most of it over the next two months. But I learned so, SO much in that time. The next 2K I invested is now 7K, which is no small amount for me. I will be investing more soon, but it's still only a part (albeit large) of my portfolio. It really helps me sleep better at night knowing that I also have some much more secure investments.\ufeff", "time": "3 days ago", "author": "\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432", "cid": "UgwugNeM8WiThX3kuJ94AaABAg"},

Look projects based on the ethereum blockchain, or tokens, and invest when they cost only a couple cents, and then HODL.\nOh yeah and STAY AWAY from bitcoin multipliers or Bitconnect scams.
