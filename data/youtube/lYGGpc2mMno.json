{"text": "I hardly disagree with what Jack Ma first said. \n\nWork, work, work and fall, fall, fall. Get life experience, observe, analyze and learn about world around you. Specialize yourself to do what drives you from inside, for those kind of activity you would like to do for the rest of your life, even if you don't do it for living in a process, learn and become really good at it, become ready. Don't enjoy the life too much until you are 30, just occasionally. Don't waste your time, energy and money prematurely. Don't try to travel as much as you can, don't go to every party or any other fucking place young people go whenever they can. That's what most people do before they commit themselves to slavishly hard work and life because they were young, naive and reckless. It's really tough to work, work, work and fall, fall, fall for the rest of your life doing what others tell you to do and you must do it because you fucked up earlier and now you have to pay the price. \nWhen you hit 30, it's time to chase and hit as soon as possible dream you trained yourself for, that thing sparking in you, that makes you happy and starts your heart beating faster while doing it. Enjoy the rest of your life while conceiving family and doing your dream job. Build the world around you, it's a lifelong process. Everything wasted second before 30 will be much more expensive tomorrow. Because all we have is this moment right now, oh and it's gone. We have to make best of this new one... And we are biologically weaker then few moments ago. And it will be a huge impact of our psyche. If we are not ready for later stage we will have only a lot and lot moments of suffering doing jobs we never wanted to do, for people we never wanted to do, with people we never wanted to do, for the rest of moments we have. And our children might pay the biggest price for that. \nDon't wait your 30's or 40's. Pursue your dreams with all your heart immediately, because that will affect your whole life and those after you.\ufeff", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Darjan", "cid": "UgxDFHX3I3lpDKxs7WJ4AaABAg"},

{"text": "Jack Ma is not a genius, nor a crook, but a genius crook. First, everyone must understand that there is no real private enterprise which can reach Fortune 500 in China without Chinese Communist Government (CCG)\u2019s control behind it. What worse is that the control is often not exercised by the government but by top level corrupted government officials and their family members. There is no secret that several most powerful CCG officials and their family members are the top shadow shareholders of Alibaba. Second, those top level government officials have used Alibaba to laundry hundreds of billions embezzled monies out of China, mostly through now CCG controlled Hong Kong into Western countries, particularly the U.S. Third, Alibaba has no new technology nor innovation but just a cheap copy of Ebay and Amazon. CCG has not only used Alibaba to stop foreign businesses such as Ebay and Amazon entering into Chinese market, but also given Alibaba monopoly in Chinese market, upon which Ma/Alibaba\u2019s successful myth is really about. For example, receiving deposits and paying interest are the financial and banking industries monopolied by the government, and many individuals and entrepreneurs have been imprisoned or even punished with death penalty because of raising capitals among friends and local people. Ma/Alibaba is the only non-state-run and non-banking business capable of receiving deposits and paying interest in China. Ma gave numerous speeches all over the world about how he became one of the richest persons in the world and how to become successful \u2013 \u201cchicken soup\u201d stories and so on, but none of what he said was true. Ma simply is the smiling face of the most evil dictatorship regime in human history, the CCG, which imprisoned Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate till his death on July 13, 2017 \u2013 something that even Adolf Hitler was not dare to do. Most importantly, in return for CCG\u2019s favor, Ma has shamelessly promoted for CCG the dictatorship ideology and publicly supported CCG\u2019s Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 using tanks and machine guns against its own peaceful people! Ma is a new phenomena challenging the conscience of every one of us in today\u2019s world \u2013 do we still respect universal human values as our first priority, or money is everything and we should do whatsoever we can to get money, power, and fame, like Jack Ma?\ufeff", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "\u536b\u7acb", "cid": "Ugz51TOEUxOi6im6BXl4AaABAg"},

{"text": "Very smart man, because he learned the fundamentals of making money threw mistakes and his bosses at an early age. Only a fool would not listen when he speaks. For even if only 10% is useful coming from his Wisdom, that 10% is worth a million alone. \n   \nHe's old now, but he is one of the greatest if not the greatest, warriors in the business of making money, of our time. I'm 31, and don't have much going for me besides the mental mindset of not worrying about the future. Not because I have a way, but because I've based my life around giving all I have to those in need around me, and in doing so time and time again going broke. You may say I was a fool, but in doing so I learned a very great skill, which each time I've done it, I got better at it. \n  \nThat is the ability to give everything away, leave me naked on the street. Give me 1 month usually 1 to 2 weeks. I'll have everything I had before back. At first it took me 6 months todo. Now 2 weeks usually. I learned the skill of making money where there is no money. Just by people trusting in my word alone, and it being to them gold in bank worth 3x whatever I ask.    Thing is I don't go into debt, i flat line on income to 0, but never go into debt which means I'd have alot more if I hadn't helped people. \n \n However guiding my friends, family my community to a better future is more important than me having more. I believe in an old style of thinking we rise and fall together. A healthy community means a healthy amount of money and jobs to go around.Yes, some bad apple have made me look a fool. However, it is better they make me a fool than my neighbors who own business in the community, for if they go under the whole goes under. My community is healthier than ever now. \n\nA golden looking age as it were. Now at 31, I can finally gain what I had, and then build upon a future after. My investments though crazy at times, have shown fruitful returns in teaching me and boosting my community up. My activism against drugs has drug use also at an all time low within 60 miles in any direction. While I may not have millionares backing me, I can walk onto prac any company in that range and get a job on face value. I see a bright future and hope to expand what I consider my community, till everyone is growing together. Because the thing i'm most passionate about the most is helping others.\n \n I maybe strong alone, but I'll stumble like anyone else. When that happens my weaknesses show, by growing your community with you, they are their to make sure its just a stumble, so that you never fall. We all have different strengths mine is seeing potiental in others realizing options they don't see and adapting to situations. Its that faith and belief, that makes me so trust worthy and loyal, why its at the core of what makes me, me.\ufeff", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "Jarad Shaw", "cid": "UgwlBQAoZvqUhv8aLsF4AaABAg"},

However, I believe what Mr. Ma means by that is you are at your best at your prime time (physically and mentally). These two qualities deteriorate over time as we age.  As we age we tend to want to settle down and enjoy the fruits of our labor and hopefully share those fruits with others, particularly the young ones. In this case, sharing our knowledge and wisdom with them in so doing to help nurture them into the right paths in life. If I may say, a lot of things we believe are beyond us in understanding and reach are actually possible only if we can put in the time and effort to understand how they can really be achieved.

I am sure that they will also block me on facebook,so that I will not be able to comment any more.When the seller sent wrong item,then I selected for partial refund and not return item back.I also requested Ali that if seller need for return then seller must respond on all fees for shipping back.The seller has not relied any on the case but has provided on the page that full refund or partial refund if item not as described.Ali cann't change my proposal because seller has not replied any on the case. Please Like and Share this to all.I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY MR. JACK MA (THE CEO AND THE BIG BOSS OF ALIEXPRESS & ALIBABA NOT DOING ANYTHING EVEN HE ALREADY GOT MY COMMENTS) I open dispute for partial refund on order number 84770087064926 via Aliexpress value $529 from Hong Kong because seller sent me wrong item of value $75 only. But seller has not responded on dispute then Ali decided and forced me to return for full refund and buyer pay for shipping back which will cost me more than $150 for shipping back. Is this a good protection to buyer on this website ? I am feeling that Ali tried to protect fraud chinese seller.If seller not respond then Ali must decide on my proposal only and refund me soon. The wrong item has been sent to me with deliberately not good by seller, so I am right to choose for partial refund of $500 without return item. Ali cann't force to for other proposal. Am I right ? That means they will not change their decided of injustice\nMany people claimed about Ali website but none of them respond any because they are milksop and they are leader of all theft in Ali. Even jack ma has also changed his profile name in facebook to hide somewhere because he got my complained and he scared to respond.\nThe Ali's team staff never respond on any comments. That means they will not solve any problems because they protect all fraud seller\ufeff", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "sasi tho", "cid": "Ugw7EvXnCl9WxbmYpfN4AaABAg"},

I have been finding out, by living in Silicon Valley, that entrepreneurs mostly come from wealthy families (but most try not to highlight this fact).\n\nThe real way to solve economic equality in the USA is for limousine liberals to stop caring about the rest of the world more than their countrymen. Notice how Jack Ma speaks of the rural parts of China and how respectful he is. Also, the whole world has sympathy for the rural areas in developing countries. Somehow, the USA rural areas are made fun of, especially by the limousine liberals. Care about your own country first, then care about others! There is a saying in China that \"Chinese people care about their family but not about strangers.\" They say that \"Americans care about strangers but not their family.\" It's time liberals start embracing the white working class instead of demonizing them. After all, they are the ones always protecting the country in times of war. Trying to sustain this long-term peace has only helped China and made things worse for the USA. China is a huge cheater and can speak nice things but the actions speak louder than the words. Just like political-correctness, as long as you are cheating and stabbing someone in the back but are perfectly politically-correct, you are admired. Such is the way of China and the limousine liberal (who are mostly super-wealthy Chinese living in the USA anyway, displacing the American dream of owning a house and not really caring about their home country, and then complain about the white working class).\ufeff", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Dur3000Z", "cid": "UgwSv9QLtwxPvC1t7Pd4AaABAg"},
