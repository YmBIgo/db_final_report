I woudn't have bothered with the removal of the good ol' 3.5mm headphone jack IF they have dissed their lightnig connector for the new USB type C. Which seems to become the new industry standard, and would have allowed all companies to follow up.\nThe idea that Jobs talked about in this interview, we can see it with the developement of the MacBook. Which again dissed all connectors (USB A, mini DP, Lightning and power) for ONE USB type C. Francly i was happy when they have done that, but at the same NOT happy with the fact that it had only ONE of those connectors.

Tim Cook should resign and be replaced by someone who knows what to look for and knows what they are doing (In a tech sense), I understand he used to be a developer but who ever is in control should know what tech is emerging or working, If a new technology could be implemented that IS better they should implement it slowly rather than going 0-100 like they did with the lightening port or firewire. USB type C is the victor in this situation and I do believe it may replace the 3mm Headphone jack but it will take time and some thought into how to listen and charge at the same time, Maybe wireless charging will take off and allow the user to charge and listen or maybe future phones will have 2 USB type C ports, but currently we just don't know. We have to wait for tech to be more fleshed out or offer both options (USBC and 3mm) like the Nexus line in order to fully get rid of one type of tech.

The Moto Z Force released a few months ago was the first smartphone to market without the headphone jack. And there will be many more to come, now that Motorola and Apple have done it. The end is nigh for the 3.5mm jack; stop being a luddite and join the rest of society and upgrade. Or don't, and continue to use obsolete phones from the 2010s that still support the 3.5mm until the day you die. It makes no difference to me. Just don't complain when NEW technology comes out that excludes old, obsolete technology from the 1920s from its design.\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sean McNamara", "cid": "UgjZ9sGFO5aM3HgCoAEC.8IdXfywHu8w8IdstnuSkIA"},

{"text": "+Sean McNamara He's talking about the whole of a phone rather than it's tech that is widely excepted making a false equivalent. Steve was smart in how he did business, he and his team picked and choose things that are up and coming. Than they would help popularise that, but they made sure they kept some bit of the device's tech not popular. This is a tactic many businesses use to have a strangle hold in a industry. So like the ports for audio and chargers is different. This is now a strangle hold not needed. This is a tactic that is saying yes we expected the future but we also want to keep some parts of are tech in a state were you have to buy from us or are partner's long term because this small other tech is not widely used. The automotive industry did this several times and made a killing beyond belief.\n\n  Like he said the widely excepted and used audio port is a 3.5mm. Thus sense audio ports if you didn't know, do not and has not advanced and switched at as fast a rate as the others.\n\n  Why use a phone that is over priced, under performing, and requires strangle hold tech? The answer is that of opinion. But also do note that the 3.5mm won't go out of style like the hard drive they use or most other fast advancing tech any time soon. It's the same with batteries, they just aren't advancing at a fast enough rate. We will be stuck with crap tech in areas that see either no need to advance because the rest of the tech is not ahead yet or we simply just don't know how to make that happen yet.\n\n  Well in the end it's up to you to decide if you want to use tech that requires a lot more from you or something that is easily compatible with everything else. Like you said basically everything is Bluetooth supported so why not get the ultimate compatible device. One that works with all of them. It has a 3.5mm and Bluetooth options.\ufeff\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Magnus Error", "cid": "UgjZ9sGFO5aM3HgCoAEC.8IdXfywHu8w8Ie0tYnuPLr"},

{"text": "+Magnus Error Sorry, not about to concede over your anecdotes. The industry shouldn't shift its practices because you don't use 3.5mm headphones. I don't even use headphones half the time, but it is useful when I need to use it. Private calls, Aux into my car, and audio recording for voice overs on the go if I have to resort to it. But that's not the point since all that is anecdotal as well. My argument is for the majority of people who depend on it, otherwise there would be no outrage at all. For starters, this wasn't entirely about removing the headphone jack. My comment was arguing the reason why Steve Jobs is talking about what he is talking about in the video; and the uploader's description of it applying to the headphone jack removal.\n\nHis conversation in this video is entirely irrelevant to this situation of the headphone jack removal. Steve Jobs was a visionary and understood what needed to be done. My argument is Apple now, without Steve Jobs has gone into a walled garden mentality of trapping people with proprietary tech.\n\nWas there a way for them to remove the headphone jack and come out of this on top? Absolutely. By adopting industry standards like USB-C or even microUSB (because everyone and their mother has those cables), and wireless charging so that if a dongle is needed for 3.5mm -- they don't have to worry bout the charging aspect. See, it's the whole idea of slowly removing tech that is accessible to all platforms and by majority users to trapping them inside where there is no longer consumer choice, and all Apple.\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Element7", "cid": "UgjZ9sGFO5aM3HgCoAEC.8IdXfywHu8w8IeHcxTV9Pj"},
